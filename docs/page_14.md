To raise or lower the windows, use the switch on each door. The passengers' windows can also be controlled by the switches on the driver's door.

The ignition key must be in the "ON" position.

## OPERATING THE DRIVER'S WINDOW

Push the center lever either way. The window glass moves as long as the lever is operated. For automatic operation, use the outer switch.

Push the outer switch down on the "AUTO" side. The window will fully open even if you let go of the switch. To stop the window partway, lightly push the center lever up.
