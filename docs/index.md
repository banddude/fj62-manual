## The key works in every lock.
Since the doors can be locked without a key, you should always carry a spare key in case you accidentally lock your key inside the vehicle.

## KEY NUMBER PLATE
Keep the key number plate in a safe place such as your wallet, not in the vehicle.

If you should lose your key or if you need additional keys, duplicates should be made by a Toyota dealer using the key number.

You should also put a copy of the key number with your important papers.

# Front seats —
## Adjusting seat position

Pull the lock release lever sideways. Then slide the seat to the desired position with slight body pressure and release the lever.

Do not place anything under the front seats. It might interfere with the seat-lock mechanism.

CAUTION:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- This adjustment should not be made while the vehicle is moving, as the seat may unexpectedly move and cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.
- After adjusting the seat, try sliding it forward and backward to make sure it is locked in position.

---

## Adjusting seatback angle

Lean forward and pull the lock release lever. Then lean back to the desired angle and release the lever.

If desired, the seatbacks may be fully reclined. They return to the upright position when the lever is pulled and no weight is on them.

CAUTION:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- This adjustment should not be made while the vehicle is moving, as the seatback may unexpectedly move backward and cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

- After adjusting the seatback, exert body pressure to make sure it is locked in position.
- To reduce the risk of sliding under the lap belt during a collision, avoid reclining the seatback any more than needed. The seat belts provide maximum protection when the driver and the passenger are sitting well back and straight up in the seats. If you are reclined, the lap belt may slide past your hips and apply restraint forces directly to the abdomen. Therefore, in the event of a frontal collision, the risk of personal injury may increase with increasing recline of the seatback.

2. Remove the headrests, unlock the seatback and fold it down.

This will enlarge the luggage compartment as far as the raised seat cushion. See "Luggage stowage precautions" in Part 2 for what to observe in loading luggage.

Lift either of the seatback levers up to unlock the seatback.

10800104

3. Push down on the seatback until the U-shaped wires on the seatback engage with the catches.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When returning the seatback to the upright position, make sure that it is securely locked by pushing forward and rearward on the top of the seatback, and that the seat belts are in position.

# Headrests

![headrest diagram]()

To raise the headrest, pull it up. To lower it, press the lock release button and push the headrest down.

The headrest is most effective when it is close to your head. Therefore, using a cushion on the seatback is not recommended.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Adjust the top of the headrest so that it is closest to the top of your ears.
- After adjusting the headrest, make sure it is locked in position.
- Do not drive with the headrests removed.

# Seat belts —
## — Seat belt precautions

Toyota recommends that the driver and passengers in the vehicle be properly restrained at all times with the seat belts provided. Failure to do so could increase the chance of injury and/or the severity of injury in accidents.

Baby or small child. Use a child restraint system which fits your vehicle. See "Child restraint" for details.

Children. If they are too big for child restraint systems, they should sit in the rear seat and be restrained with the seat belts. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat. Do not allow the child to stand up or kneel on the seat. If the shoulder belt falls across the child's neck or face, move the child to the center position and use the center lap belt.

Pregnant woman. Toyota recommends the use of a seat belt. Ask your doctor for specific recommendations. The lap belt should be worn securely and as low as possible over the hips and not on the waist.

Injured person. Toyota recommends the use of a seat belt. Depending on the injury, however, first check with your doctor.

---

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Persons should ride in their seats properly wearing their seat belts whenever the vehicle is moving. Otherwise, they are much more likely to suffer serious bodily injury, in the event of sudden braking or a collision.

When using the seat belts, observe the following:

- Use the belt for only one person at a time. Do not use a single belt for two or more people—even children.
- Avoid reclining the seatbacks too much. The seat belts provide maximum protection when the seatbacks are in the upright position. (See "Adjusting seatback angle".)
- Be careful not to damage the belt webbing or hardware, and take care that they do not get caught or pinched in the seat or doors.
- Inspect the belt system periodically. Check for cuts, frays, and loose parts. Damaged parts should be replaced. Do not disassemble or modify the system.

## Page 17

- Keep the belts clean and dry. If they need cleaning, use a mild soap solution or lukewarm water. Never use bleach, dye, or abrasive cleaners—they may severely weaken the belts.

- Replace the belt assembly if it has been used in a severe impact. The entire assembly should be replaced even if damage is not obvious.

- 3-point type seat belts

![illustration 10170F02]()

Adjust the seat as needed and sit well back in the seat and straight up. To fasten your belt, pull it out of the retractor and insert the tab into the buckle.

You will hear a click when the tab locks into the buckle.

The seat belt length automatically adjusts to your size and the seat position.

The retractor will lock the belt during a sudden stop or on impact. At other times you can move around freely.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After inserting the tab, make sure that the connection is secure and the belt is not twisted.

![illustration 10170F03]()
TAKE UP SLACK →  
TOO HIGH ←  
KEEP AS LOW ON HIP BONE AS POSSIBLE

Adjust the position of the lap and shoulder belts.

Position the lap belt as low as possible on your hips — not on your waist, then adjust it to a snug fit by pulling the shoulder portion upward through the latch plate.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- High-positioned lap belts and loose-fitting shoulder belts both could increase the chance of injury due to sliding under the lap belt during an accident.

- For your safety, do not place the shoulder belt under your arm.

## To release the belt, press the buckle-release button and allow the belt to retract.

If the belt does not smoothly retract, pull it out and check for kinks or twists. Then make sure that it remains untwisted as it retracts.

---

## Sit well back in the seat and straight up. To fasten your belt, insert the tab into the buckle.

You will hear a click when the tab locks into the buckle.

If the belt is not long enough for you, hold the tab at a right angle to the belt and pull on the tab.

**CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

After inserting the tab, make sure that the connection is secure and the belt is not twisted.

---

## Remove excess length of the belt and adjust the belt position.

To shorten the belt, pull the free end of the belt.

Position the lap belt as low as possible on your hips — not on your waist, then adjust it to a snug fit.

**CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

High-positioned lap belts could increase the chance of injury due to sliding under the lap belt during an accident.

## — Seat belt extender

If your seat belt cannot be fastened securely because it is not long enough, a personalized seat belt extender is available from your Toyota dealer free of charge.

Please contact your local Toyota dealer so that the dealer can order the proper required length for the extender. Bring the heaviest coat you expect to wear for proper measurement and selection of length. Additional ordering information is available at your Toyota dealer.

**CAUTION::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::**

When using the seat belt extender, observe the following. Failure to follow these instructions could result in less effectiveness of the seat belt restraint system in case of vehicle accident, causing personal injury.

- Never use the seat belt extender if you can fasten the seat belt without it.
- Remember that the extender provided for you may not be safe when used on a different vehicle, or for another person and at different seating position than specified.

---

To connect the extender to the seat belt, insert the tab into the seat belt buckle so that the buckle-release buttons of the extender and the seat belt are located on the same side as shown.

You will hear a click when the tab locks into the buckle.

When releasing the seat belt, press on the buckle-release button on the extender, not on the seat belt. This helps prevent damage to the vehicle interior and extender itself.

When not in use, remove the extender and store in the vehicle for future use.

*To release the belt, press the buckle-release button.*

# Child restraint—
## —Child restraint precautions

Toyota strongly urges the use of child restraint systems for children small enough for the child restraint system.

The laws of all fifty states in the U.S.A. and most provinces in Canada now require the use of child restraint system.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For effective protection in automobile accidents and sudden stops, children must not be transported unrestrained. Holding a child in your arms is not a substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, a child held in a person's arms can be crushed between the vehicle's interior and an unrestrained person.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After inserting the tab, make sure that the connection is secure and the seat belt extender is not twisted.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## —Child restraint system

A child restraint system for a small child or baby must be restrained on the seat with either the lap belt or the lap portion of the lap/shoulder belt.

The child restraint system should conform to the size of the child and properly fit the vehicle seat. For a higher degree of safety, the child restraint system should be installed in the rear seat. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.

When installing a child restraint system, you must use a locking clip for the following seat belts.

* Front seat belt
* Rear outside seat belt

When installing a child restraint system, refer to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the system and follow the directions listed under the following illustrations.

If the locking clip does not come with your child restraint system, you can purchase it from your Toyota dealer.

* Locking clip (Part No. 73119-22010)

## Page 21

# CAUTION:.........................................................

After installation, make sure the child restraint system is secure in place. If the child restraint system is not restrained securely, it may cause injury to the child in case of vehicle accident and sudden stops.

When not using the child restraint system, keep it secured with the seat belt or remove it and place it somewhere other than in the vehicle to prevent injury to passengers in event of a sudden stop or accident.

## Outside rear view mirrors—

Adjust the mirror so you can just see the side of your vehicle in the portion of the mirror closest to the vehicle.

Be careful when judging the size or distance of any object seen in the outside rear view mirror on the passenger's side. It is a convex mirror with a curved surface. Any object seen in a convex mirror will look smaller and farther away than when seen in a flat mirror.

RIGHT TURN  
LANE CHANGE  
LEFT TURN

For signaling turns, move the lever up or down in the conventional manner.

The key must be in the "ON" position.

The turn signal is self-cancelling after a turn, but after a lane change, you may have to cancel it by hand. You can also signal a lane change by moving the turn signal lever part-way and holding it there. If the green dashboard light flashes faster than normal, it indicates that the front or rear turn signal bulb has burned out. If the dashboard light does not come on, the fuse or the indicator light itself has probably failed. You may change headlight beam even while the turn signal lights are flashing.

## Fuel gauge

*NEARLY FULL*  
*NEARLY EMPTY*

10320101

The gauge works when the ignition switch is on and indicates approximate quantity of fuel remaining in the tank.

It is a good idea to keep the tank over 1/4 full.

The needle moves when braking, accelerating or making turns. This is caused by the movement of the fuel in the tank.

Do not drive with the fuel level below the "E". It may cause engine misfire, and damage to the catalytic converter.

---

## Engine temperature gauge

*NORMAL RANGE* → *OVERHEATING*

10330101

The gauge indicates the engine coolant temperature when the ignition switch is on. The engine operating temperature will vary with changes in weather and engine load.

If the needle points to the red zone or higher, stop your vehicle and allow the engine to cool.

Your vehicle may overheat during severe operating conditions, such as:
- Driving up a long hill on a hot day.
- Reducing speed or stopping after high speed driving.
- Idling for a long period with the air conditioner on in stop-and-go traffic.
- Towing a trailer.

---

## NOTICE:

Do not remove the thermostat in the engine cooling system as this may cause the engine to overheat. The thermostat is designed to control the flow of coolant to keep the temperature of the engine within the specified operating range.

Do not continue driving with an overheated engine. See "If your vehicle overheats" in Part 4.

# Oil pressure gauge

The oil pressure gauge indicates engine oil pressure when the ignition is on. Check it while driving to make sure that the needle is in the proper range.

If the oil pressure should stay below the normal range, pull off the road to a safe place and stop the engine immediately. Call a Toyota dealer or qualified repair shop for assistance.

Oil pressure may not build up when the oil level is too low. The oil pressure gauge is not designed to indicate oil level, and the oil level must be checked using the level dipstick.

**NOTICE:**

Do not drive the vehicle with the oil pressure below the normal range until the cause is fixed — it may ruin the engine.

10360101

# Voltmeter

The voltmeter tells whether the battery is charged or discharged. Check it while the engine is running — the needle should always indicate as shown above.

If the needle reads below or above the normal range while the engine is running, it indicates the charging system needs immediate repair.

However, it is normal for the needle to drop below the normal range during engine starting.

# Tachometer

DO NOT RUN INTO RED ZONE

The tachometer indicates engine speed in thousands of rpm (revolutions per minute). Use it while driving to prevent engine overrevving.

Driving with the engine running too fast causes excessive engine wear and poor fuel economy. Remember, in most cases the slower the engine speed, the greater the fuel economy.

NOTICE:  
Do not run the needle into the red zone.  
This may cause severe engine damage.

# Odometer and trip meter

ODOMETER

TRIP METER

RESETTING KNOB

The odometer records the total distance the vehicle has been driven. The trip meter may be set to zero to record the distance on each trip. To set the trip meter, press the knob in and release it.

# (a) Brake System Warning Light

This light has the following functions:

## Parking brake reminder
If this light is on, make sure the parking brake is fully released. The light should go off.

## Low brake fluid level warning
If this light comes on and stays on while you are driving, slow down and pull off the road. Then stop the vehicle carefully. Remember that stopping distance and pedal effort may be increased. There may be a problem somewhere in the brake system. Check the fluid level of the see-through reservoir.

To make sure that the parking brake has not caused the warning light to come on, check to see that the parking brake is fully released.

If the brake fluid level is low...
At a safe place, test your brakes by starting and stopping.

- If you judge that the brakes still work adequately, drive cautiously to your nearest dealer or shop for repairs.
- If the brakes are not working, have the vehicle towed in for repairs. (For towing information, see Part 4.)

---

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Continued normal driving with low brake fluid level is dangerous.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If the brake fluid level is correct...
Have the warning system checked by your Toyota dealer.

## (b) Seat Belt Reminder Light and Buzzer
As a reminder to you and your passengers, this light will come on for about 4 to 8 seconds each time the ignition key is placed at "ON" or "START". The buzzer will operate only if the driver's seat belt is not fastened.

## (c) Discharge Warning Light
This light warns that the battery is being discharged.

If it comes on while you are driving, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and check for the cause. Look first at the engine drive belt (alternator belt).

- If it is loose or broken, the alternator will not charge the battery properly.
- If the belt is OK, there is a problem somewhere in the charging system.

The engine ignition will continue to operate, however, until the battery is discharged. Turn off the air conditioner, blower, radio, etc., and drive directly to the nearest Toyota dealer or repair shop.

NOTICE:

Do not continue driving if the engine drive belt (alternator belt) is broken or loose.

## (d) Engine System Warning Light
This light warns that there is a problem somewhere in your engine electrical system.

If it comes on while you are driving, have your vehicle checked/repaired by your Toyota dealer as soon as possible.

On vehicles sold in Calif., the light also warns that there is a problem somewhere in your engine emission control system and you can check your engine system by blinking the warning light. (For detailed information, see "Checking the engine system" in Chapter 7-2.)

## (e) Unengaged "Park" Warning Light
This light warns that the transmission "Park" mechanism is not engaged. If the front drive control is in the "N" position while the selector lever is in the "P" position, the transmission will disengage and the wheel will not lock.

## Page 36

To restore the park function, shift the front drive control either to "H2" or "L4".

### (f) Automatic Transmission Fluid Temperature Warning Light

This light warns that the automatic transmission fluid temperature is high.

If this light comes on while you are driving, slow down and pull off the road, put the selector lever in "P" and leave the engine idling until the light goes off. If the light goes off, you can start the vehicle again. If the light does not go off, call a Toyota dealer or qualified repair shop for assistance.

### (g) Key Reminder Buzzer

This buzzer reminds you to remove the key when you open the driver's door with the ignition key in the "ACC" or "LOCK" position.

### How to check all the warning lights:

1. Apply the parking brake.  
2. Place the transfer in "N" position and the transmission in "P" position.  
3. Turn the ignition key to "ON", but do not start the engine.

All the warning lights should come on.

If any warning light or buzzer does not function, either the bulb is burned out or the circuit is in need of repair. Have it checked as soon as possible.

20041104

To use the braking power of the engine, downshift the transmission in the way described below:

- Shift into the "3" range when the vehicle speed is lower than 81 mph (130 km/h). The transmission will downshift to the third gear.

- Shift into the "2" range when the vehicle speed is lower than 53 mph (85 km/h). The transmission will downshift to the second gear and more engine braking will be obtained.

- Shift into the "L" range when the vehicle speed is lower than 25 mph (40 km/h). The transmission will downshift to the first gear and maximum engine braking will be applied.

**CAUTION:**

Be careful when downshifting on a slippery surface. The abrupt change in engine speed could cause the vehicle to spin or skid.

**NOTICE:**

To prevent engine overrevving, do not downshift if you are going faster than the above speed in each range.

cruisercult.com

---

# (c) Using the "3", "2" and "L" ranges

The "3", "2" and "L" ranges are used for strong traction in addition to strong engine braking as described previously. The mechanism for this is that the transmission uses mainly lower gears.

With the selector lever in "3", "2" or "L", you can start the vehicle in motion as with the lever in "D".

With the selector lever in "3", the vehicle will start in the first gear and automatically shift to the second and third gears, but will not shift to the overdrive gear. This provides strong traction such as for climbing a gentle slope.

With the selector lever in "2", the transmission is engaged in the second gear and will not upshift or downshift at all. This provides strong traction such as for hill climbing.

With the selector lever in "L", the transmission is engaged in the first gear and will not upshift at all. This provides maximum traction such as for hard towing.

41

![Page 41](images/page-041.jpg)

## Page 42

**NOTICE:**

Be careful not to overrev the engine. Watch the tachometer to keep engine rpm from going into the red zone. The maximum allowable speed (approximate) for each range is given below for your reference:

- "3" ........... 81 mph (130 km/h)  
- "2" ........... 53 mph (85 km/h)  
- "L" ........... 25 mph (40 km/h)

### (d) Backing up

- BRAKE PEDAL  
- SELECTOR LEVER

1. Bring the vehicle to a complete stop.  
2. With the brake pedal held down with your foot, shift the selector lever to the "R" range.

**NOTICE:**  
Never shift into reverse while the vehicle is in motion.

### (e) Parking

- PARKING BRAKE LEVER  
- BRAKE PEDAL  
- SELECTOR LEVER  
- "P" (Park) range

1. Bring the vehicle to a complete stop.  
2. Pull the parking brake lever up fully to securely apply the parking brake.  
3. With the brake pedal held down with your foot, shift the selector lever to the "P" range.

**CAUTION:**  
While the vehicle is in motion, never attempt to move the selector lever into "P" under any circumstances. Serious mechanical damage and loss of vehicle control may result.

![Page 42](images/page-042.jpg)

---

## Page 43

# (f) Good driving practice

- If the transmission is repeatedly upshifted and downshifted between the third and overdrive gears when climbing a gentle slope, it is suggested that the "3" range be used. Be sure to return to the "D" range immediately afterward.
- When towing a trailer, in order to maintain engine braking efficiency and electrical charging performance, do not use the "D" range.

CAUTION:
Always keep your foot on the brake pedal while stopped with the engine running. This prevents the vehicle from creeping.

NOTICE:
Do not hold the vehicle on an upgrade with the accelerator pedal. It can cause the transmission to overheat. Always use the brake pedal or parking brake.

# Four-wheel drive system — (a) Front drive control lever and "H4" button

(Image labels: H2 · N · L4 ; H4 ON OFF)

The function of each of the front drive control lever and "H4" button positions is described below.

The "4WD" indicator light shows when the front drive control lever is in the "L4" position or when the "H4" button is pushed in.

"H2": High range, two-wheel drive  
Use this for normal driving on dry hard-surfaced roads. This position gives greater economy, quietest ride and least wear. The "H4" button must be off.

"H4": High range, four-wheel drive  
Use this for normal driving on wet, icy or snow-covered roads. This position provides greater traction than two-wheel drive.

"N": Neutral  
No power is delivered to the wheels. Use this position only for operating a winch or other equipment. The vehicle must be stopped.

"L4": Low range, four-wheel drive  
Use this for maximum power and traction. Use "L4" for climbing or descending steep hills, off-road driving, and hard pulling in sand, mud or deep snow.

See "(c) Shifting procedure" for further instructions.

# (b) Free-wheeling hubs

![diagram]

To engage the free-wheeling hubs, turn the hubs to "LOCK". To disengage, turn the hubs to "FREE".

Make sure that the triangle mark on the hub aligns with the other one at the side you wish to set.

Setting the free-wheeling hubs in "FREE" allows you to disengage the front axle and driveshaft so that they are not revolving. This reduces noise and wear when the vehicle is in two-wheel drive.

You should drive with the hubs in "LOCK" for at least 10 miles (16 km) each month. This will assure that the front drive components are lubricated.

---

# (c) Shifting procedure

## SHIFTING BETWEEN "H2" AND "H4"

To shift from "H2" to "H4", push the "H4" button in to the ON position with the front drive control lever in the "H2" position and both the free-wheeling hubs engaged. Then release the accelerator pedal momentarily.

The vehicle may be moving at any speed.

CAUTION:
- Never move the front drive control lever if wheels are slipping. Stop the slipping or spinning before shifting.
- Never drive with only one hub engaged.

To shift from "H4" to "H2", push the "H4" button out to the OFF position. Disengage both the free-wheeling hubs for continued "H2" use.

The vehicle may be moving at any speed.

## SHIFTING BETWEEN "H2" AND "L4"

To shift from "H2" to "L4", stop the vehicle, shift the transmission into "P" or "N" and move the front drive control lever with both the free-wheeling hubs engaged. If you cannot shift, drive the vehicle slightly in either direction and try again.

To shift from "L4" to "H2", stop the vehicle, shift the transmission into "P" or "N" and move the front drive control lever. If you cannot shift, drive the vehicle slightly in either direction and try again.

# Differential locks

![20150108]

The purpose of the differential locks is for use only when the vehicle has not enough traction to move itself.

The differential is designed to transmit power from the engine to the right and left wheels equally. If one wheel is off the ground or on a slippery surface, the power is used to spin the wheel, causing insufficient traction on the other wheel.

Locking the differential allows the right and left wheels to rotate as a unit, causing the vehicle to extract itself.

## Operating precautions

- If the vehicle does become stuck, first engage the four-wheel drive, low range (L4) to free it. If this has no effect, lock the rear, and if necessary, also the front differential.
- The order of operation is, rear-front lock and front-rear unlock.
- Be sure to unlock the differentials immediately after using the differential locks.
- Before normal driving, make sure that the differential control levers are pushed down and the indicator lights remain off.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Before locking the differentials, be sure that the wheels have stopped spinning. If not, the vehicle may move in an unexpected direction when the differential locks are engaged, resulting in an accident. This may also lead to possible damage to differential lock component parts.
- Do not use the differential locks on dry, hard roads. Large steering effort and careful cornering control will be required. Especially use of the front differential lock in addition to the rear will result in extremely difficult steering control.
- Do not drive on snow or ice with the differentials locked. Cornering may be difficult. If one wheel contacts a non-slippery surface during acceleration or engine braking, the vehicle may spin suddenly.

---

NOTICE:

Do not drive over 5 mph (8 km/h) when the differentials are locked.

# Cases in which the differential locks can be used effectively

These are some of the cases where the differential locks are effective. In every case, first apply the brakes to stop the wheel and engage the four-wheel drive, low range (L4). If this does not help, use the differential locks.

- Wheel off the road

  After pulling up on the control lever, depress the accelerator pedal gently. Shortly after the wheel has revolved, the differential will lock, causing both wheels to move as a unit to quickly get the wheel back on the road.

- Driving over rocky roads

  Keep both hands and especially your thumbs on the outside of the rim.

**CAUTION:** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not grip the steering wheel spokes. The return motion can be so sudden and harsh that your hands may be injured.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

- Freeing from snow (wheels on one side on a slippery surface)

  After engaging the locks up, accelerate slowly out of the snow. Pressing down on the accelerator pedal too hard and too quickly can cause loss of vehicle control. When the entire vehicle is back on the road, do not forget to disengage the differential locks.

# Car audio operating tips

**Figure labels:** SERVICE AREA · FM (stereo) · FM (monaural) · AM · MULTIPATH · STATIC · 10563-01

You can listen to the car audio when the ignition key is at "ON" or "ACC". However, if the engine is not running, the key must be in the "ACC" position.

**NOTICE:**
To prevent the battery from being discharged, do not leave the car audio on for a long period while the engine is not running.

## RADIO
Adjust the length of your antenna for best reception. Usually a short length is best in large cities and a fully extended antenna is best for distant reception.

Before extending the antenna, confirm that there is no one close enough to get poked.

50

**NOTICE:**
To prevent damage to the antenna, make sure it is retracted before running your vehicle through an automatic car wash.

## FM reception tips
A vehicle is not an ideal place to listen to a radio. Because it moves, reception conditions are constantly changing. Buildings, terrain, signal distance and noise from other vehicles are all working against good reception. Some conditions of FM may appear to be problems when they are not. The following characteristics are completely normal for a given reception area, and they do not indicate any problem with the radio itself.

- Fading and Drifting: FM range is limited to about 25 miles (40 km), except for some high power stations.  
  If a vehicle is moving away from the desired station's transmitter, the signal will tend to fade and/or drift. This is a more remarkable phenomenon than with AM, and is accompanied by distortion.  
  Fading and drifting can be minimized to a certain degree by careful attention to fine tuning, or you should retune the radio to a stronger signal.

![Page 50](images/page-050.jpg)

## Page 51

- Static and Fluttering: When the line-of-sight link between a transmitter and vehicle is blocked by large buildings or the like, the radio sound may be accompanied with static or fluttering because of the characteristic of FM. In a similar effect, a fluttering noise is sometimes heard when driving along a tree-lined road.

  This static and fluttering can be reduced by adjusting the tone control for greater bass response until the disturbance has passed.

- Multipath: Because of the reflecting characteristics of FM, direct and reflected signals may reach the antenna at the same time (multipath) and cancel each other out. As a vehicle moves through these electronic dead spots, the listener may hear a momentary flutter or loss of reception.

- Station swapping: When two FM stations are close to each other, and an electronic dead spot, such as static or multipath area, interrupts the original signal, sometimes the stronger second signal will be selected automatically until the original one returns. This swapping can also occur as you drive away from the selected station and approach another station of a stronger signal.

### CASSETTE TAPE PLAYER

Use only cassette tapes of good quality, having no damage. Avoid using tapes with a total playing time longer than 90 minutes.

Using damaged tapes would put the tape player into trouble. Longer tapes are not recommended because of their thinness.

Be sure that the tape is not slack and that the label is firmly stuck on the shell before insertion.

Have the tape firmly wound around the tape hub by turning the hub with a pencil or the like.

Be careful not to touch the exposed tape surface.

---

When not in use, take the cassette out of the player, put it back into its case and store it away from dust, magnets and direct sunlight.

Leaving the cassettes on the dashboard in the sun could result in damaged tapes.

Keep the playback head, capstan and pinch roller clean.

Remove tape coating residue accumulated on the head, capstan and pinch roller once or twice a month. A cleaning tape is available on the market.

NOTICE:

Do not oil any part of the player and do not insert metal goods or a magnet into the slot, or the tape player may be damaged.

# Break-in period

Drive gently and avoid high speeds.

You need not follow a break-in schedule with your new Toyota. But following a few simple tips for the first 1000 miles (1600 km) can add to the future economy and long life of your vehicle:

- Do not drive over 55 mph (88 km/h).
- Avoid overrevving. Maintain engine speed between 2000 and 4000 rpm.
- Avoid full-throttle starts.
- Try to avoid hard stops during the first 200 miles (300 km).
- Do not drive for a long time at any single speed, either fast or slow.
- Do not tow a trailer during the first 500 miles (800 km).

We recommend that for the first 300 miles (500 km) you place the front drive control lever in the "H2" position and lock both free-wheeling hubs. For detailed information, see "Four-wheel drive system" and "Free-wheeling hubs" in Chapter 1-6.

# Fuel

## FUEL TYPE

Your new vehicle must use only unleaded gasoline.

To help prevent gas station mixups, your Toyota has a new smaller fuel tank opening. The special nozzle on pumps with unleaded fuel will fit it, but the larger standard nozzle on pumps with leaded gas will not.

**NOTICE:**

Do not use leaded gasoline. Use of leaded gasoline will cause the catalytic converter to lose its effectiveness and the emission control system to function improperly. Also, this can increase maintenance costs.

## OCTANE RATING

Select Research Octane No. 91 (Octane Rating 87) or higher.

Use of unleaded fuel with an octane number or rating lower than stated above will cause persistent heavy knocking. If severe, this will lead to engine damage.

# If your engine knocks...

If you detect heavy knocking even when using the recommended fuel, or if you hear steady knocking while holding a steady speed on level roads, consult your Toyota dealer.

However, now and then, you may notice light knocking for a short time while accelerating or driving up hills. This is no cause for concern.

## GASOLINES CONTAINING ALCOHOL

If you use gasohol in your Toyota, be sure that it is unleaded, has an octane rating no lower than 87 and does not contain more than 10% ethanol. Toyota does not recommend the use of gasolines containing methanol.

Gasohol is a mixture of gasoline and ethanol.

If you use gasoline containing methanol, use only gasoline meeting the requirements above and also containing less than 5% methanol with cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors for methanol.

cruisercult.com

93

![Page 93](images/page-093.jpg)

---

## Page 94

# NOTICE:
Do not use gasohol other than stated above. It will cause fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems.

If driveability problems are encountered (poor hot starting, vaporizing, engine knock, etc.), discontinue the use.

Take care not to spill gasohol during refueling. Gasoline containing alcohol may cause paint damage.

## FUEL TANK CAPACITY
23.8 gal. (19.8 Imp. gal., 90 liters)

---

# Operation in foreign countries
If you plan to drive your Toyota in another country...

First, comply with the vehicle registration laws.

Second, confirm the availability of the correct fuel (unleaded and minimum octane rating).

---

# Catalytic converters
The catalytic converter is an emission control device installed in the exhaust system.

It looks somewhat like a muffler, but its purpose is to reduce pollutants in the exhaust gas.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Keep people and combustible materials away from the exhaust pipe while the engine is running. The exhaust gas is very hot.

- Do not idle or park your vehicle over anything that might burn easily such as grass, leaves, paper or rags.

cruisercult.com

![Page 94](images/page-094.jpg)

---

## Page 95

# NOTICE:

A large amount of unburned gas flowing into the converter may cause it to overheat and create a fire hazard. To prevent this and other damage, observe the following precautions:

- Use only unleaded gasoline.
- Do not drive with an extremely low fuel level; running out of gas could cause the engine to misfire, creating an excessive load on the converter.
- Do not allow the engine to run at idle speed for more than 20 minutes.
- Avoid racing the engine.
- Do not push-start or pull-start your vehicle.
- Do not turn off the ignition while the vehicle is moving.
- Keep your engine in good running order. Malfunctions in the engine electrical, ignition or fuel systems could cause an extremely high converter temperature.

- If the engine becomes difficult to start or stalls frequently, take your vehicle in for a check-up as soon as possible. Remember, your Toyota dealer knows your vehicle and its catalytic converter system best.
- To insure that the converter and the entire emission control system operate properly, your vehicle must receive the periodic inspections required by the Toyota Maintenance Schedule.

# Engine exhaust cautions

CAUTION:

- Avoid inhaling the engine exhaust. It contains carbon monoxide, which is a colorless and odorless gas. It can cause unconsciousness or even death.
- Make sure the exhaust system has no holes or loose connections. The system should be checked from time to time. If you hit something, or notice a change in the sound of the exhaust, have the system checked immediately.
- Do not run the engine in a garage or enclosed area except for the time needed to drive the vehicle in or out. The exhaust gases cannot escape, making this a particularly dangerous situation.
- Do not remain for a long time in a parked vehicle with the engine running. If it is unavoidable, however, do so only in an unconfined area and adjust the heating or cooling system to force outside air into the vehicle.

95

![Page 95](images/page-095.jpg)

---

## Page 96

- Keep the trunk lid, back hatch or tailgate closed while driving. An open or unsealed trunk lid, back hatch or tailgate may cause exhaust gases to be drawn into the vehicle. If you must drive with the trunk lid, back hatch or tailgate open to accommodate a large object, close the windows, open all the dashboard vents and have the heating or cooling system deliver fresh air into the vehicle by turning the fan on high speeds with the air intake control set at the "FRESH", or OUTSIDE AIR position.
- To allow proper operation of your vehicle's ventilation system, keep the inlet grilles in front of the windshield clear of snow, leaves, or other obstructions.
- If you smell exhaust fumes in the vehicle, drive with the windows open and the trunk lid, back hatch or tailgate closed. Have the cause immediately located and corrected.

# Facts about engine oil consumption

## FUNCTIONS OF ENGINE OIL

Engine oil has the primary functions of lubricating and cooling the inside of the engine, and plays a major role in maintaining the engine in proper working order.

## ENGINE OIL CONSUMPTION

It is normal that an engine should consume some engine oil during normal engine operation. The causes of oil consumption in a normal engine are as follows.

- Oil is used to lubricate pistons, piston rings and cylinders. A thin film of oil is left on the cylinder wall when a piston moves downwards in the cylinder. High negative pressure generated when the vehicle is decelerating sucks some of this oil into the combustion chamber. This oil as well as some part of the oil film left on the cylinder wall is burned by the high temperature combustion gases during the combustion process.
- Oil is also used to lubricate the stems of the intake valves. Some of this oil is sucked into the combustion chamber together with the intake air and is burned along with the fuel. High temperature exhaust gases also burn the oil used to lubricate the exhaust valve stems.

The amount of engine oil consumed depends on the viscosity of the oil, on the quality of the oil and on the way the vehicle is driven.

More oil is consumed under such driven conditions as high speeds and frequent acceleration and deceleration.

A new engine consumes more oil, since its pistons, piston rings and cylinder walls have not become conditioned.

When judging the amount of oil consumption, note the oil may become diluted and make it difficult to judge the true level accurately.

As an example, if a vehicle is used for repeated short trips, and consumes a normal amount of oil, the dipstick may not show any drop in the oil level at all, even after 600 miles (1000 km) or more. This is because the oil is gradually becoming diluted with fuel or moisture, making it appear that the oil level has not changed.

The diluting ingredients evaporate out when the vehicle is then driven at high speeds, as on an expressway, making it appear that oil is excessively consumed after driving at high speeds.

# IMPORTANCE OF ENGINE OIL LEVEL CHECK

One of the most important points in proper vehicle maintenance is to keep the engine oil at the optimum level so that oil function will not be impaired. Therefore, it is essential that the oil level be checked regularly. Toyota recommends that the oil level be checked every time you refuel the vehicle.

**NOTICE:**

Failure to check the oil level regularly could lead to serious engine troubles due to insufficient oil.

For detailed information on oil level check, see "Checking the engine oil level" in Chapter 7-2.

# Brake system

## Toyota tandem master cylinder brake system

The Toyota tandem master cylinder brake system is a hydraulic system with two separate sub-systems. If either sub-system should fail, the other will still work. However, the pedal will be harder to press, and your stopping distance will be longer. Also, the brake system warning light may come on.

**CAUTION:**

Do not rely on a single brake system. Have your brakes fixed immediately.

### Brake booster

The brake booster uses engine vacuum to power-assist the brakes. If the engine should quit while you are driving, you can bring the vehicle to a stop with normal pedal pressure. There is enough reserve vacuum for one or two stops — but no more!

Do not pump the brake pedal if the engine stalls. Each push on the pedal uses up your vacuum reserve.

**CAUTION:**

Even if the power assist is completely lost, the brakes will still work. But you will have to push the pedal hard — much harder than normal. And your braking distance will be longer.

# Luggage stowage precautions

When stowing luggage or cargo in or on the vehicle, observe the following:

- Put luggage or cargo in the luggage compartment when at all possible. Be sure all items are secured in place.
- Be careful not to bring the vehicle out of level. Locating the weight as far forward as possible helps keep the balance.
- For better fuel economy, do not carry unneeded weight.

CAUTION:

- To prevent luggage or packages from sliding forward during braking, do not stack anything in the luggage compartment higher than the seatbacks.
- Never allow anyone to ride in the luggage compartment. It is not designed for passengers. They should ride in their seats with wearing their seat belts. Otherwise, they are much more likely to suffer serious bodily injury, in the event of sudden braking or a collision.

NOTICE:

Do not load the vehicle beyond the vehicle capacity weight given in Part 8.

# Before starting the engine

1. Check the area around the vehicle before entering it.

2. Adjust seat position, seatback angle, headrest height and steering wheel angle.

3. Adjust inside and outside rear view mirrors.

4. Lock all doors.

5. Fasten seat belts.

Remember to check that the warning lights function when turning the key to "ON", and check the fuel gauge to see that you have sufficient fuel.

# How to start the engine —

## (a) Before cranking

1. Apply the parking brake firmly.

2. Turn off unnecessary lights and accessories.

3. Put the selector lever in "P". If you need to restart the engine while the vehicle is moving, put the selector lever in "N". A starter safety device will prevent the starter from operating if the selector lever is in any drive position.

4. Depress the brake pedal and hold it to the floor until driving off.

## (b) Starting the engine

Before starting the engine, be sure to follow the instructions in "(a) Before cranking".

### Normal starting procedure

The electronic fuel injection system in your engine automatically controls the proper air-fuel mixture for starting. So you can start the cold or hot engine as follows:

1. With your foot off the accelerator pedal, crank the engine by turning the key to "START". Release it when the engine starts.

2. After the engine warms up for about 10 seconds, you are ready to drive.

If the weather is below freezing, let it warm up for a few minutes before driving. Do not leave the vehicle while the engine is warming up.

### If the engine stalls...

Simply restart it, using the correct procedure given in normal starting.

### If the engine will not start—

See "If your vehicle will not start" in Part 4.

**NOTICE:**

Do not crank for more than 15 seconds at a time.

Do not race a cold engine.

If the engine becomes difficult to start or stalls frequently, have the engine checked immediately.

# Off-road driving precautions

When driving your vehicle off-road, please observe the following precautions to ensure your driving enjoyment and to help prevent the closure of areas to off-road vehicles.

a. Drive your vehicle only in areas where off-road vehicles are permitted to travel.

b. Respect private property. Get owner's permission before entering private property.

c. Do not enter areas that are closed. Honor gates, barriers and signs that restrict travel.

d. Stay on established roads. When conditions are wet, driving techniques should be changed or travel delayed to prevent damage to roads.

For owners in U.S. mainland, Hawaii and Puerto Rico:

To obtain additional information pertaining to driving your vehicle off-road, consult the following organizations.

- State and Local Parks and Recreation Departments
- State Motor Vehicle Bureau
- Recreational Vehicle Clubs
- U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Always observe the following precautions to minimize the risk of serious personal injury or damage to your vehicle:

- Drive carefully when off the road. Do not take unnecessary risks by driving in dangerous places.

- Do not grip the steering wheel spokes when driving off-road. A bad bump could jerk the wheel and injure your hands. Keep both hands and especially your thumbs on the outside of the rim.

- Always check your brakes for effectiveness immediately after driving in sand, mud, or water.

- The driver and all passengers should fasten their seat belts whenever the vehicle is moving.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

NOTICE:

If driving through water, such as when crossing shallow streams, first check the depth of the water and the bottom of the river bed for firmness. Drive slowly and avoid deep water. Take all necessary safety measures to ensure that damage to the engine or other components does not occur. Water entering the engine air intake will cause severe engine damage.

Always perform a maintenance inspection after each day of off-road driving that has taken you through sand, mud, or water. (See Part 6.)

# Winter driving tips

![20100-02]

Make sure you have ethylene-glycol coolant in the radiator.

This is the type of coolant your new Toyota is delivered with and the type your dealer will always use. In addition to preventing corrosion and lubricating the water pump, this coolant will prevent freezing and subsequent damage to the engine block.

Check the condition of the battery and cables.

Cold temperatures reduce the capacity of any battery, so it must be in top shape to provide enough power for winter starting. Chapter 7-3 tells you how to visually inspect the battery. Your Toyota dealer and most service stations will be pleased to check the level of charge.

---

## Make sure the engine oil viscosity is suitable for the cold weather.

See Chapter 7-2 for recommended viscosity. Leaving a heavy summer oil in your vehicle during winter months may cause harder starting. If you are not sure about which oil to use, call your Toyota dealer — he will be pleased to help.

## Check the spark plugs and ignition system.

Make sure the plugs are not worn, fouled, or incorrectly gapped. (Chapter 7-2 has instructions for inspecting.) Visually check the rest of the system for loose connections or obvious damage.

## Keep the door locks from freezing.

Squirt lock de-icer or glycerine into the locks to keep them from freezing. To open a frozen lock, try heating the key before inserting it.

## Use a windshield washer fluid containing an antifreeze solution.

This product is available at your Toyota dealer and most auto parts stores. Follow the manufacturer's directions for how much to mix with water.

---

## NOTICE:

Do not use engine antifreeze or any other substitute because it may damage your vehicle's paint.

Do not use your parking brake when there is a possibility it could freeze.

When parking, put the transmission into "P" and block the front wheels. Do not use the parking brake.

Keep ice and snow from accumulating under the fenders.

Ice and snow built up under your fenders can make steering difficult. During bad winter driving, stop and check under the fenders occasionally.

Depending on where you are driving, we recommend you carry some emergency equipment.

Some of the things you might put in the vehicle are tire chains, window scraper, bag of sand or salt, flares, small shovel, jumper cables, etc.

# Trailer towing

Your vehicle is designed primarily as a passenger-and-load-carrying vehicle. Towing a trailer will have an effect on handling, performance, braking, durability and driving economy (fuel consumption, etc.). Your safety and satisfaction depend on the proper use of correct equipment and cautious driving habits. For your safety and the safety of others, you must not overload your vehicle or trailer. Ask your local Toyota dealer for further details before towing.

## WEIGHT LIMITS

Before towing, make sure the total trailer weight, gross combination weight, gross vehicle weight, gross axle weight and trailer tongue load are all within the limits.

The total trailer weight and tongue load can be measured with platform scales found at a highway weighing station, building supply company, trucking company, junk yard, etc.

CAUTION:||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

- The total trailer weight (trailer weight plus its cargo load) must not exceed 3500 lb. (1587 kg). Exceeding this weight is dangerous. If towing a trailer over 2000 lb. (900 kg), it is necessary to use a sway control device with a sufficient capacity.

![CERTIFICATION REGULATION PLATE/LABEL]( )

- The gross combination weight (sum of your vehicle weight plus its load and the total trailer weight) must not exceed 8000 lb. (3628 kg).

- The gross vehicle weight must not exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) indicated on the Certification Regulation Plate/Label. The gross vehicle weight is the sum of weights of the unloaded vehicle, driver, passengers, luggage, hitch and trailer tongue load. It also includes the weight of any special equipment installed on your vehicle.

- The load on either the front or rear axle resulting from distribution of the gross vehicle weight on both axles must not exceed the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) listed on the Certification Regulation Plate/Label.

# TOTAL TRAILER WEIGHT

TONGUE LOAD

TONGUE LOAD  
TOTAL TRAILER WEIGHT

TONGUE LOAD  
————— × 100 = 9 to 11 %

20110-03

---

- The trailer cargo load should be distributed so that the tongue load is 9 to 11 % of the total trailer weight, not exceeding the maximum of 350 lb. (158 kg). Never load the trailer with more weight in the back than in the front. About 60 % of the trailer load should be in the front half of the trailer and the remaining 40 % in the rear.

---

# HITCHES

- Use only a weight carrying hitch designed for the total trailer weight. Toyota does not recommend using a weight distribution (load equalizing) hitch.  
- The hitch must be bolted securely to the vehicle frame and installed according to the hitch manufacturer's instructions.  
- The hitch ball and king pin should have a light coat of grease.  
- TOYOTA recommends removing the hitch when not towing to prevent injury and/or damage due to the hitch in event of a rear end collision. After removal of the hitch, seal the installation area to prevent entry of exhaust fumes and mud.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not use an axle-mounting hitch as it may cause damage to the axle housing, wheel bearings, wheels and/or tires.

**BRAKES AND SAFETY CHAINS**

- TOYOTA recommends trailers with brakes that conform to any applicable federal and state/provincial regulations.

---

# CAUTION

- If the total trailer weight exceeds 1000 lb. (450 kg), trailer brakes are required.  
- Never tap into your vehicle's hydraulic system as it would lower its braking effectiveness.  
- If damage occurs to the coupling unit or hitch ball, there is danger of the trailer wandering over into another lane. Therefore, a safety chain must always be used between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Leave sufficient slack in the chain for turns. The chain should cross under the trailer tongue to prevent the tongue from dropping to the ground in case it becomes damaged or separated. For correct safety chain procedures, follow the hitch or trailer manufacturer's recommendations.

## TIRES
- Ensure that your vehicle's tires are properly inflated. Adjust tire pressure to the recommended cold tire pressure indicated below:

Tire pressure, psi (kg/cm2, kPa)
- Front 26 (1.8, 180)
- Rear 41 (2.8, 280)

- The trailer tires should be inflated to the pressure recommended by the trailer manufacturer in respect to the total trailer weight.

## TRAILER LIGHTS
- Trailer lights must comply with federal, state/provincial and local regulations. See your local recreational vehicle dealer or rental agency for the correct type of wiring and relays for your trailer. Check for correct operation of the turn signals and stop lights each time you hitch up. Direct splicing may damage your vehicle's electrical system and cause a malfunction of your lights.

## BREAK-IN SCHEDULE
- TOYOTA recommends that you do not tow a trailer with a new vehicle or a vehicle with any new power train component (engine, transmission, differential, wheel bearing, etc.) for the first 500 miles (800 km) of driving.

108

## MAINTENANCE
- If you tow a trailer, your vehicle will require more frequent maintenance due to the additional load. Refer to the maintenance schedule under severe driving conditions (schedule A) in Part 6 for specific information.

## PRE-TOWING SAFETY CHECK
- Check that your vehicle maintains a level position when a loaded and unloaded trailer is hitched. Do not drive if the vehicle has an abnormal nose-up or nose-down condition, and check for improper tongue load, overload, worn suspension or other possible causes.
- Be sure the trailer cargo is securely loaded so that it may not shift.
- Check that your rear view mirrors conform to any federal, state/provincial or local regulation. If not, install required rear view mirrors for towing purpose.

## TRAILER TOWING TIPS
When towing a trailer, your vehicle will handle differently than when not towing. The three main causes of vehicle-trailer accidents are driver error, excessive speed and improper trailer loading. Keep these in mind when towing:

- Before starting out, check operation of the lights and all vehicle-trailer connections. After driving a short distance, stop and recheck the lights and connections. Before actually towing a trailer, practice turning, stopping and backing with a trailer in an area away from traffic until you learn the feel.
- Because stopping distance may be increased, vehicle-to-vehicle distance should be increased when towing a trailer. For each 10 mph (16 km/h) of speed, allow at least one vehicle and trailer length between you and the vehicle ahead. Avoid sudden braking as you may skid, resulting in jackknifing and loss of control. This is especially true on wet or slippery surfaces.
- Avoid jerky starts or sudden acceleration.
- Avoid jerky steering and sharp turns. The trailer could hit your vehicle in a tight turn. Slow down before making a turn to avoid the necessity of sudden braking.
- Remember that when making a turn, the trailer wheels will be closer than the vehicle wheels to the inside of the turn. Therefore, compensate for this by making a larger than normal turning radius with your vehicle.

# BACKING

![steering diagram](20110-04)

LEFT TURN ← RIGHT TURN

- Backing with a trailer is difficult and requires practice. Grip the bottom of the steering wheel and move your hand to the left to move the trailer to the left. Move your hand to the right to move the trailer to the right. (This procedure is generally opposite to that when backing without a trailer). Also, just turn the steering wheel a little at a time, avoiding sharp or prolonged turning. Have someone guide you when backing to reduce the risk of an accident.

- Crosswinds and rough roads will adversely affect handling of your vehicle and trailer, causing sway. Pay attention to the rear from time to time to prepare yourself for being passed by large trucks or buses, which may cause your vehicle and trailer to sway. If swaying happens, firmly grip the steering wheel and reduce speed immediately but gradually. Never increase speed. Steer straight ahead. If you make no extreme correction with the steering or brakes, the combination will stabilize itself.

- Be careful when passing other vehicles. Passing requires considerable distance. After passing a vehicle, do not forget the length of your trailer and be sure you have plenty of room before changing lanes.

- In order to maintain engine braking efficiency and electrical charging performance, do not use the "D" range.

- Because of the added load of the trailer, your vehicle's engine may overheat on hot days (at temperatures over 85°F [30°C]) when going up a long or steep grade with a trailer. If the engine temperature gauge indicates overheating, immediately turn off the air conditioner (if in use), pull off the road and stop in a safe spot. Refer to "If your vehicle overheats" in Part 4 of this manual.

- Always place wheel blocks under both the vehicle and trailer wheels when parking. Apply the parking brake firmly. Put the transmission in "P". Avoid parking on a slope with a trailer, but if it cannot be avoided, do so only after performing the following:

  1. Apply the brakes and hold.
  2. Have someone place wheel blocks under both the vehicle and trailer wheels.
  3. When the wheel blocks are in place, release your brakes slowly until the blocks absorb the load.
  4. Apply the parking brake firmly.
  5. Shift into "P" and turn off the engine.

When restarting out after parking on a slope:

  1. With the transmission in "P" range, start the engine. Be sure to keep the brake pedal depressed.
  2. Shift into the "3", "2", "L" or "R" range.
  3. Release the parking brake and brake pedal and slowly pull or back away from the wheel blocks. Stop and apply your brakes.
  4. Have someone retrieve the blocks.

# CAUTION:

- Do not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h) or the posted towing speed limit, whichever is lower. Because instability (swaying) of a towing vehicle-trailer combination usually increases as the speed increases, exceeding 45 mph (72 km/h) may cause loss of control.

- Slow down and downshift before descending steep or long downhill grades. Do not make sudden downshifts.

- Avoid holding the brake pedal down too long or too frequently. This could cause the brakes to overheat and result in reduced braking efficiency.

# How to save fuel and make your vehicle last longer, too

Getting more mileage/kilometers from a gallon/liter of fuel is easy — just take it easy. It will help make your vehicle last longer, too. Here are some specific tips on how to save money on both fuel and repairs:

- Keep your tires inflated at the correct pressure. Check the pressure at least once a month. Underinflation causes tire wear and wastes fuel.

- Do not carry unneeded weight in your vehicle. Excess weight puts a heavier load on the engine, causing greater fuel consumption.

- Avoid lengthy warm-up idling. Once the engine is running smoothly, begin driving — but gently. Remember, however, that in cold winter days this may take a little longer.

- Accelerate slowly and smoothly. Avoid jackrabbit starts.

- Avoid long engine idling. If you have a long wait and you are not in traffic, it is better to turn off the engine and start again later.

- Avoid engine overrevving. Use a gear range suitable for the road you are travelling on.

- Use your air conditioner only when absolutely necessary. The air conditioner puts an extra load on the engine.

- Avoid continuous speeding up and slowing down. Stop-and-go driving wastes fuel.

- Avoid unnecessary stopping and braking. Maintain a steady pace. Try to time the traffic signals so you only need to stop as little as possible or take advantage of through streets to avoid traffic lights. Keep a proper distance from other vehicles to avoid sudden braking. This will also reduce wear on your brakes.

- Avoid heavy traffic or traffic jams whenever possible.

- Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal. This causes needless wear, overheating and poor fuel economy.

- Maintain a moderate speed on highways. The faster you drive, the greater the fuel consumption. By reducing your speed, you will cut down on fuel consumption.

- Keep the front wheels in proper alignment. Avoid hitting the curb and slow down on rough roads. Improper alignment not only causes faster tire wear but also puts an extra load on the engine, which, in turn, wastes fuel.

![Page 110](images/page-110.jpg)

---

## Page 111

- Keep the bottom of your vehicle free from mud, etc. This not only lessens weight but also helps prevent corrosion.

- Keep your vehicle tuned-up and in top shape. A dirty air cleaner, improper valve clearance, dirty plugs, dirty oil and grease, brakes not adjusted, etc. all lower engine performance and contribute to poor fuel economy. For longer life of all parts and lower operating costs, keep all maintenance work on schedule, and if you often drive under severe conditions, see that your vehicle receives more frequent maintenance (See Part 6).

**CAUTION:**
Never turn off the engine to coast down hills. Your power steering and brake booster will not function without the engine running. Also, the emission control system operates properly only when the engine is running.

# If your vehicle will not start—
## (a) Simple checks

Before making these checks, make sure that you have followed the correct starting procedure instructed in "How to start the engine" in Part 3 and that you have sufficient fuel.

### If the engine is not turning over or is turning over too slowly—
1. Check that the battery terminals are tight and clean.  
2. If the battery terminals are O.K., switch on the interior light.  
3. If the light is out, dim or goes out when the starter is cranked, the battery is discharged. You may try jump starting. See "(c) Jump starting" for further instructions.

If the light is O.K., but the engine still will not start, it needs adjustment or repair. Call a Toyota dealer or qualified repair shop for assistance.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not pull- or push-start the vehicle. It may damage the vehicle or cause a collision when the engine starts. Also the catalytic converter may overheat and become a fire hazard.

---

### If the engine turns over at its normal speed but will not start—
1. Check that all the push-on connectors are tight at the ignition coil, distributor, and spark plugs.

See Chapter 7-1 for locations of these parts.

2. If the connectors are O.K., the engine may be flooded because of repeated cranking. See "(b) Starting the flooded engine" for further instructions.

3. If the engine still will not start, it needs adjustment or repair. Call a Toyota dealer or qualified repair shop for assistance.

---

## (b) Starting the flooded engine

If the engine will not start, your engine may be flooded because of repeated cranking.

If this happens, turn the key to "START" with the accelerator pedal held down. Keep the key and accelerator pedal held down for 15 seconds and release them. Then try starting the engine with your foot off the accelerator pedal.

If the engine does not start after 15 seconds of cranking, release the key, wait a few minutes and try again.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not crank for more than 15 seconds at a time.

## Page 115

## (c) Jump starting

To avoid serious personal injury and damage to your vehicle which might result from battery explosion, acid burns, electrical burns, or damaged electronic components, these instructions must be followed precisely.

If you are unsure about how to follow this procedure, we strongly recommend that you seek the help of a competent mechanic or towing service.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Batteries contain sulfuric acid, which is poisonous and corrosive. Wear protective safety glasses when jump starting, and avoid spilling acid on your skin, clothing, or vehicle. If you should accidentally get acid on yourself or in your eyes, remove any contaminated clothing and flush the affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. If possible, continue to apply water with a sponge or cloth while enroute to the medical office.

- The gas normally produced by a battery will explode if a flame or spark is brought near. Therefore, do not smoke or light a match while jump starting.

NOTICE:

The battery used for boosting must be 12-volt. Do not jump start unless you are sure that the booster battery is correct.

JUMP STARTING PROCEDURE

1. If the booster battery is installed in another vehicle, make sure that the vehicles are not touching. Turn off all unnecessary lights and accessories.

2. Remove all the vent caps from the booster battery. Lay a cloth over the open vents on the booster battery. (This helps reduce the explosion hazard.)

If the booster battery is an extended maintenance interval battery, it is not necessary to remove the filler caps.

3. If the engine in the vehicle with the booster battery is not running, start it and let it run for a few minutes. During jumping run the engine at about 2000 rpm with the accelerator pedal lightly depressed.

4. Connect the jumper cables in the exact order shown in the illustration: positive-to-positive(+), and negative-to-engine or body ground(−). Note that you first connect the positive cable to the discharged battery and then to the booster battery. Next, connect the negative cable to the booster battery and then to a solid, stationary, metallic point (e.g. engine hanging hook) away from the battery. Do not connect it to or near any part that moves when the engine is cranked.

**NOTICE:**

When making the connections, do not lean over the battery or accidentally let the jumper cables or clamps touch anything except the correct battery terminals or the ground.

5. Start your engine in the normal way. After starting, run it at about 2000 rpm for several minutes with the accelerator pedal lightly depressed.

6. Carefully disconnect the cables in the exact reverse order: the negative cable and then the positive cable.

7. Carefully dispose of the battery cover cloths—they may now contain sulfuric acid.

8. Replace all the battery vent caps.

If the cause of your battery discharging is not apparent (for example, lights left on), you should have it checked.

116

## If your vehicle overheats

If your temperature gauge indicates overheating, if you experience a loss of power, or if you hear a loud knocking or pinging noise, the engine has probably overheated. You should follow this procedure...

1. Pull safely off the road, stop the vehicle, put the transmission in "P" and apply the parking brake. Turn off the air conditioner if it is being used.

2. If coolant or steam is boiling out of the radiator or reservoir, stop the engine. Wait until the steam subsides before opening the hood. If there is no coolant boiling over or steam, leave the engine running.

3. Visually check to see if the engine drive belt (fan belt) is broken or loose. Look for obvious coolant leaks from the radiator, hoses, and under the vehicle. However, note that water draining from the air conditioner is normal if it has been used.

**CAUTION:** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When the engine is running, keep hands and clothing away from the moving fan and engine drive belts.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. If the engine drive belt is broken or the coolant is leaking, stop the engine immediately. Call a Toyota dealer for assistance.

5. If the engine drive belt is O.K. and there are no obvious leaks, you may help the engine cool down more quickly by running it at about 1500 rpm for a few minutes with the accelerator pedal lightly depressed.

6. Check the coolant reservoir. If it is dry, add water to the reservoir while the engine is running. Fill it about half full.

**CAUTION:** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not attempt to remove the radiator cap when the engine and radiator are hot. Serious injury could result from scalding hot fluid and steam blown out under pressure.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7. After the engine temperature has cooled to normal, again check the coolant level in the reservoir or if necessary, bring it up to half full again. Serious coolant loss indicates a leak in the system. You should have it checked as soon as possible at your Toyota dealer.

# If you have a flat tire —

1. Make sure you are completely off the road — well away from the traffic. Avoid stopping on the center divider of a highway. Park on a level spot with firm ground.

2. Stop the engine and turn on your emergency flashers.

3. Firmly set the parking brake and put the transmission in "P".

4. Have everyone get out of the vehicle on the side away from traffic.

5. Read the following instructions thoroughly. They are designed to help a person who has never before changed a tire.

CAUTION:
When jacking, be sure to observe the following to reduce the possibility of personal injury:

- Follow jacking instructions.
- Use a jack only for lifting your vehicle during wheel changing.
- Never get beneath the vehicle when supported by a jack.
- Do not start or run the engine while your vehicle is supported by a jack.

## — Loosening wheel nuts

4. Loosen all the wheel nuts.

Always loosen the wheel nuts before raising the vehicle.

The nuts turn counterclockwise to loosen. To get maximum leverage, fit the wrench to the nut so that the handle is on the right side, as shown above. Grab the wrench near the end of the handle and pull up on the handle. Be careful that the wrench does not slip off the nut.

Do not remove the nuts yet—just unscrew them about one-half turn.

---

## — Positioning the jack

5. Position the jack at the correct jack point as shown.

Make sure that the jack is positioned on a level and solid place.

JACK POINTS:

Front —  
Under the front axle housing between the leaf spring and stabilizer bar

Rear —  
Under the rear axle housing near the wheel to be raised

---

## — Raising your vehicle

6. After making sure that no one is in the vehicle, raise it high enough so that the spare tire can be installed.

Remember that you will need more ground clearance when putting on the spare tire than when removing the flat tire.

To raise the vehicle, insert the jack handle extension into the jack (it is a loose fit) and turn it clockwise with the handle. As the jack touches the vehicle and begins to lift, double-check that it is properly positioned.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Never get under the vehicle when it is supported by the jack alone.

- Changing wheels

7. Remove the wheel nuts and change tires.

Lift the flat tire straight off and put it aside. Roll the spare wheel into position and align the holes in the wheel with the bolts. Then lift up the wheel and get at least the top bolt started through its hole. Wiggle the tire and press it back over the other bolts.

Before putting on wheels, remove any corrosion on the mounting surfaces with a wire brush or such. Installation of wheels without good metal-to-metal contact at the mounting surface can cause wheel nuts to loosen, and eventually cause a wheel to come off while driving. Therefore after the first 1000 miles (1600 km), check to see that the wheel nuts are tight.

- Reinstalling wheel nuts

8. Reinstall all the wheel nuts finger tight.

Reinstall the wheel nuts and tighten them as much as you can by hand. Press the tire back and see if you can tighten them more.

## Reinstalling wheel ornament

INSTALLATION TOOL

10. Reinstall the wheel ornament.

Put the wheel ornament into position and then tap it firmly with the side or heel of your hand to snap it into place.

On ornaments for free-wheeling hubs, place the installing tool over the opening and tap on the tool to snap the ornament into place. Be careful not to slip off the tool.

---

## After changing wheels

11. Check the air pressure of the replaced tire. Restow all the tools, jack and flat tire securely.

Adjust the air pressure to the specification. If the pressure is lower than specified, drive slowly to the nearest service station and fill to the correct pressure.

Do not forget to reinstall the tire inflation valve cap as dirt and moisture could get into the valve core and possibly cause air leakage. If the cap is missing, have a new one put on as soon as possible.

This is the same procedure for changing or rotating your tires.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Before driving, make sure that all the tools, jack and flat tire are securely in place in their storage location to reduce the possibility of personal injury during a collision or sudden braking.

# If your vehicle needs to be towed —

If towing is necessary, we recommend you have it done by your Toyota dealer or commercial tow truck service.

Proper equipment will help ensure that your vehicle is not damaged while being towed. Commercial operators are generally aware of the state/provincial and local laws pertaining to towing.

Your vehicle can be damaged if it is towed incorrectly. Although most operators know the correct procedure, it is possible to make a mistake. Rather than risk damage to your vehicle, why don't you make sure that the following few precautions are observed. If necessary, show this page to the tow truck driver.

## TOWING PRECAUTIONS:

Use a safety chain system for all towing, and abide by the state/provincial and local laws. The wheels and axle on the ground must be in good condition. If they are damaged, use a towing dolly.

The vehicle may be towed from either the front or rear. We recommend using a towing dolly when towing from the rear.

---

- Towing with rear wheels on ground

  Release the parking brake and put the transmission in "N" and the transfer in "H2". Disconnect the rear propeller shaft at the rear differential if the vehicle must be towed faster than 30 mph (45 km/h) or farther than 50 miles (80 km).

  NOTICE:

  Do not tow faster or farther than the above limits without disconnecting the rear propeller shaft. This causes transmission damage.

- Towing with four wheels on ground

  Disengage both free-wheeling hubs (if so equipped), place the ignition key in the "ACC" position and observe the precautions described in "Towing with rear wheels on ground".

  NOTICE:

  Do not tow with the key removed or in the "LOCK" position, as the steering lock mechanism is not strong enough to hold the front wheels straight while towing.

- Towing with front wheels on ground

  Put the transmission in "N" and the transfer in "H2" and place the ignition key in the "ACC" position. Disengage both free-wheeling hubs (if so equipped).

---

NOTICE:

Do not tow with the key removed or in the "LOCK" position, as the steering lock mechanism is not strong enough to hold the front wheels straight while towing.

## Emergency towing

![TOWING HOOK](30200102)

For emergency towing, secure a cable to the towing hook.

Towing in this manner must not be done if the wheels, axles, drive train, steering or brakes are damaged.

Before towing, release the parking brake and put the transmission in "N" and the transfer in "H2". The key must be in "ACC" (engine off) or "ON" (engine running).

A driver must be in the vehicle to steer it and operate the brakes.

---

## Towing hook precautions

- Before towing, check that the hook installation bolts are not loose.
- Fasten the towing rope or cable securely to the hook.
- Do not jerk the hook.
- To avoid damaging the hook, do not pull from the side or at a vertical angle. Always pull straight ahead.

---

### CAUTION:
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If the engine is not running, the power assist for the brakes and steering will not work so steering and braking will be much harder than usual.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### NOTICE:
Use the towing hook only when your vehicle must be towed on hard-surfaced roads.

# If you lose your key

Many Toyota dealers can make a new key if you can give them the key number.

See the suggestion given in "Key" in Chapter 1-2.

If your key is locked in the vehicle and you cannot get a duplicate, many Toyota dealers can still open the door for you, using their special tools. If you must break a window to get in, we suggest breaking the smallest side window because it is the least expensive to replace. Be extremely cautious to avoid cuts from the glass.

# Protecting your Toyota from corrosion

Toyota, through its diligent research, design and utilizing the most advanced technology available, has done its part to help prevent corrosion and has provided you with the finest quality vehicle construction. Now, it is up to you. Proper care of your Toyota can help ensure long-term corrosion prevention.

## The most common causes of corrosion to your vehicle are:
- The accumulation of road salt, dirt and moisture in hard-to-reach areas under the vehicle.
- Chipping of paint, or undercoating caused by minor accidents or by stones and gravel.

## Care is especially important if you live in a particular area or operate your vehicle under certain environmental conditions:
- Road salt or dust control chemicals will accelerate corrosion, as will the presence of salt in the air near the sea-coast or in areas of industrial pollution.
- High humidity accelerates corrosion especially when temperatures range just above the freezing point.
- Wetness or dampness to certain parts of your vehicle for an extended period of time, may cause corrosion even though other parts of the vehicle may be dry.
- High temperatures will cause corrosion to those components of the vehicle which are prevented from quick-drying due to lack of proper ventilation.

The above signifies the necessity to keep your vehicle, particularly the underside, as clean as possible and to repair any damage to paint or protective coatings as soon as possible.

To help prevent corrosion on your Toyota, follow these guidelines:

### Wash your vehicle frequently.
It is, of course, necessary to keep your vehicle clean by regular washing, but to prevent corrosion, the following points should be observed:
- If you drive on salted roads in the winter or if you live near the ocean, you should hose off the undercarriage at least once a month to minimize corrosion.
- High pressure water or steam is effective for cleaning the vehicle's underside and wheel housings. Pay particular attention to these areas as it is difficult to see all the mud and dirt. It will do more harm than good to simply wet the mud and debris without removing them. The lower edge of doors, rocker panels and frame members have drain holes which should not be allowed to clog with dirt as trapped water in these areas can cause corrosion.
- Wash the underside of the vehicle thoroughly when winter is over.

See "Washing and waxing your Toyota" for more tips.

### Check the condition of your vehicle's paint and trim.
If you find any chips or scratches in the paint, touch them up immediately to prevent corrosion from starting. If the chips or scratches have gone through the bare metal, have a qualified body shop make the repair.

### Check the interior of your vehicle.
Water and dirt can accumulate under the floor mats and could cause corrosion. Occasionally check under the mats to make sure the area is dry. Be particularly careful when transporting chemicals, cleansers, fertilizers, salt, etc., and these should be transported in proper containers. If a spill or leak should occur, immediately clean and dry the area.

### Use mud shields on your wheels.
If you drive on salted or gravel roads, mud shields help protect your vehicle. Full-size shields, which come as near to the ground as possible, are the best. We recommend that the fittings and the area where the shields are installed be treated to resist corrosion. Your Toyota dealer will be happy to assist in supplying and installing the shields if they are recommended for your area.

# Washing and waxing your Toyota

**Do not park your vehicle in a damp, poorly ventilated garage.**  
If you wash your vehicle in the garage, or if you drive it in covered with water or snow, your garage may be so damp it will cause corrosion. Even if your garage is heated, a wet vehicle can corrode in it if the ventilation is poor.

Wash your vehicle in the shade when the body is not hot to the touch. Use a mild car-wash soap and rinse it well.

Dirt can cause small scratches in the paint and the chemicals in some dirt and air pollutants can cause deterioration of the paint and trim. Therefore, frequent washing is recommended. If you park or drive your Toyota near the ocean or on salted roads, it is especially important to prevent corrosion.

Your vehicle can be washed in an automatic car wash. Remember, however, that the paint surface could then be scratched with the brushes. Scratches reduce the paint's gloss retention and durability. They can become apparent easily, especially on the darker paints.

The following is the adequate procedure of car washing by hand.

1. Begin by rinsing all loose dirt off the vehicle with a hose. If the underside has picked up mud or road salt, use a hard, direct stream from a hose to remove it.  
2. Wash with a commercial car-wash product available at your Toyota dealer or auto parts store. Follow the manufacturer's mixing instructions carefully. Dip your sponge or cloth into the wash bucket frequently and do not rub too hard—let the soap and water remove the dirt.

Road tar may be removed with turpentine. Use warm water and car-wash soap for insects and tree sap. Commercial products are also available.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not use gasoline or strong solvents, which may be toxic or cause damage.

3. Rinse the vehicle thoroughly. If any soap dries on the vehicle, it may cause streaking. In hot weather, you may have to rinse each section of the vehicle right after you wash it.  
4. Dry the vehicle with a moist chamois or soft towel. The main purpose of drying is to remove excess water so that the vehicle will air dry without water spots. So do not rub or press hard, which might scratch the paint.

If you detect any stone chips or scratches in the paint, touch them up immediately to protect the bare metal from corrosion.

After washing your vehicle, make sure the brakes are fully dry before driving.

Polishing and waxing is recommended to maintain the original beauty of your Toyota's finish.

1. Always wash and dry the vehicle before you begin waxing, even if you are using a combined cleaner and wax.

## Page 128

2. Use a good quality polish and wax. If the finish has become extremely weathered, use a car-cleaning polish, followed by a separate wax. Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions and precautions. Be sure to polish and wax the chrome trim as well as the paint.

3. Wax the vehicle again when water does not bead but remains on the surface in large patches.

# Cleaning the interior

The vinyl upholstery may be easily cleaned with a mild soap or detergent and water.

First vacuum over the upholstery to remove loose dirt. Then, using a sponge or soft cloth, apply the soap solution to the vinyl. After allowing it to soak in for a few minutes to loosen the dirt, remove the dirt and wipe off the soap with a clean damp cloth. If all the dirt does not come off, repeat the procedure. Commercial foaming-type vinyl cleaners are also available which work well. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.

**NOTICE:**

Do not use solvent, thinner, gasoline or window cleaner on the interior

Use a good foam-type shampoo to clean the carpets.

Begin by vacuuming thoroughly to remove as much dirt as possible. Several types of foam cleaners are available; some are in aerosol cans and others are powders or liquids which you mix with water to produce a foam. To shampoo the carpets, use a sponge or brush to apply the foam. Rub in overlapping circles. Do not apply water — the best results are obtained by keeping the carpet as dry as possible. Read the shampoo instructions and follow them closely.

The seat belts may be cleaned with mild soap and water or with lukewarm water.

Use a cloth or sponge. As you are cleaning, check the belts for excessive wear, fraying, or cuts.

**NOTICE:**

Do not use dye or bleach on the belts — it may weaken them.

The windows may be cleaned with any household window cleaner.

**NOTICE:**

When cleaning the inside of the windows, be careful not to scratch or damage the heater wires on the rear window.

If you have any questions about the cleaning of your Toyota, your local Toyota dealer will be pleased to answer them.

- Maintenance requirements
- General maintenance
- Does your vehicle need repairing?
- Scheduled maintenance

# Maintenance requirements

Your Toyota vehicle has been designed to give less maintenance requirements with long service interval to save both your time and money. However, each regular maintenance as well as day-to-day care is more important than ever before to ensure smooth and trouble-free, safe, and economical drivings.

It is owner's responsibility to make sure that the specified maintenance including general maintenance services is performed. Note that both the new vehicle and emission control system warranties specify that proper maintenance and care must be performed. See Owner's Guide or Warranty Booklet for complete warranty information.

## General maintenance

General maintenance items are those day-to-day care practices that are important to your vehicle for proper operation. It is the owner's responsibility to insure that the general maintenance items are performed regularly.

These checks or inspections can be done either by yourself or a qualified technician, or if you prefer, your Toyota dealer will be pleased to do them at a nominal cost.

## Scheduled maintenance

The scheduled maintenance items listed in this part are those required to be serviced at regular intervals.

However, under severe driving conditions, a separate maintenance schedule that requires more frequent maintenance service should be practiced.

It is recommended that any replacement parts used for maintenance or for the repair of the emission control system be Toyota supplied.

The owner may elect to use non-Toyota supplied parts for replacement purposes without invalidating the emission control system warranty. However, use of replacement parts which are not of equivalent quality may impair the effectiveness of the emission control systems.

You may also elect to have maintenance, replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and system performed by any automotive repair establishment or individual without invalidating this warranty. See Owner's Guide or Warranty Booklet for complete warranty information.

## Where to go for service?

Toyota technicians are well-trained specialists and are kept up to date with the latest service information through technical bulletins, service tips, and in-dealership training programs. They learn to work on Toyotas before they work on your vehicle, rather than while they are working on it.

You can be confident that your Toyota dealer's service department performs the best job to meet the maintenance requirements on your vehicle—reliably and economically.

Your copy of the repair order is proof that all required maintenance has been performed for warranty coverage. And if any problems should arise with your vehicle while under warranty, your Toyota dealer will promptly take care of it. Again, be sure to keep a copy of the repair order for any service performed on your Toyota.

## What about do-it-yourself maintenance?

Many of the maintenance items are easy to do yourself if you have a little mechanical ability and a few basic automotive tools. Simple instructions for how to perform them are presented in Part 7.

If you are a skilled do-it-yourself mechanic, the Toyota service manuals are recommended. Please be aware that do-it-yourself maintenance can affect your warranty coverage. See your separate warranty statement for the details.

# Does your vehicle need repairing?

Be on the alert for changes in performance, sounds, and visual tip-offs that indicate service is needed. Some important clues are as follows:

- Engine missing, stumbling, or pinging
- Appreciable loss of power
- Strange engine noises
- A leak under the vehicle (however, water dripping from the air conditioner after use is normal.)
- Change in exhaust sound (This may indicate a dangerous carbon monoxide leak. Drive with the windows open and have the exhaust system checked immediately.)
- Flat-looking tire; excessive tire squeal when cornering; uneven tire wear
- Vehicle pulls to one side when driving straight on a level road
- Strange noises related to suspension movement
- Loss of brake effectiveness; spongy feeling brake pedal; pedal almost touches floor; vehicles pull to one side when braking
- Engine temperature continually higher than normal
- Engine continually runs hot; oil pressure gauge stays low

If you notice any of these clues, take your vehicle to your Toyota dealer as soon as possible. It probably needs adjustment or repair.

**CAUTION: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

> Do not continue driving with the vehicle unchecked. It could result in serious vehicle damage and possibly personal injury.

**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

# Scheduled maintenance —

Driving conditions under which you mainly operate your vehicle determine which maintenance schedule you follow.

In order to ensure smooth, trouble-free, safe and economical driving, Toyota provides two kinds of maintenance schedules to be selected according to your driving conditions: schedules A and B. The instructions on which schedule to follow are given on the next page.

An odometer reading or time interval determines when service is necessary.

For most people, the odometer reading will indicate when service is needed. If, however, you drive very little, your vehicle should be serviced at regular time intervals as shown in the schedule.

The maintenance services beyond the last period should be performed at the same intervals.

The service interval of each item can be obtained from the maintenance schedule.

# Do-it-yourself service precautions

If you perform maintenance by yourself, be sure to follow the correct procedure given in this part.

You should be aware that improper or incomplete servicing may result in operating problems.

Performing do-it-yourself maintenance during the warranty period may affect your warranty coverage. Read the separate Toyota Warranty statement for details and suggestions.

This part gives instructions only for those items that are relatively easy for an owner to perform. As explained in Part 6, there are still a number of items that must be done by a qualified technician with special tools.

For information on tools and parts for do-it-yourself maintenance, see "Parts and tools".

Utmost care should be taken when working on your vehicle to prevent accidental injury. Here are a few precautions that you should be especially careful to observe:

### CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- When the engine is running, keep hands, clothing, and tools away from the moving fan and engine drive belts. (Removing rings, watches, and ties is advisable.)

- Right after driving, the engine, radiator and exhaust manifold will be hot, so be careful not to touch them. Oil and fluid may also be hot.

- Do not smoke, cause sparks or allow open flames around fuel or battery. The fumes are inflammable.

- Be extremely cautious when working on the battery. It contains poisonous and corrosive sulfuric acid.

- Do not get under your vehicle with just the body jack supporting it. Always use automotive jack stands or other solid supports.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### NOTICE:

Remember that battery and ignition cables carry high currents or voltages. Be careful of accidentally causing a short circuit.

When closing the engine hood, check to see that you have not forgotten any tools, rags, etc.

```
60040F01

With the engine at operating temperature and turned off, check the oil level on the dipstick.

1. To get a true reading, the vehicle should be on a level spot. After turning off the engine, wait a few minutes for the oil to drain back into the bottom of the engine.

2. Pull out the dipstick, and wipe it clean with a rag.

3. Reinsert the dipstick — push it in as far as it will go, or the reading will not be correct.

4. Pull the dipstick out and look at the oil level on the end. If it is between the "F" and "L" marks, it is O.K.

60050F04

If the oil level is below the "L" mark, add engine oil.

Remove the oil filler cap and add engine oil in small quantities at a time, checking the dipstick. If the level reaches within the correct range, install the filler cap hand-tight.

NOTICE:
Avoid overfilling, or the engine could be damaged.

---

## Engine oil selection

Use engine oil of API grade SF or SF/CC. Determine the viscosity considering your climate. Recommended viscosity is as follows. Using multigrade and fuel-efficient engine oil is recommended.

Recommended viscosity (SAE):

- 5W-30
- 10W-30
- 10W-40
- 10W-50
- 15W-40

# Changing the engine oil and filter

![60050F01]

1. Warm up the engine for a few minutes and then turn it off. Remove the oil filler cap.
a. Park the vehicle on a level spot. Warm up the engine until the engine temperature gauge shows a rise. (Warm oil will drain faster and more thoroughly.) Turn the engine off.
b. Remove the oil filler cap. This allows air to enter the engine as the oil drains.

![60050-04 LOOSEN]

2. Remove the drain plug and allow the oil to drain fully.
a. Place a drain pan under the drain plug.
b. Using a wrench, remove the drain plug. Allow the oil to drain fully.

CAUTION: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The oil may be hot—be careful not to burn yourself.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

![60050F03 LOOSEN]

3. Remove the old oil filter and install a new one hand-tight. Reinstall the drain plug.
a. Using an oil filter wrench (any of several common types will work), loosen the oil filter. It turns counterclockwise. Once loose, you may unscrew it the rest of the way by hand. When removing it, hold up the end so that oil does not spill out.
b. With a clean rag, wipe off the mounting surface on the engine so that the new filter will seat well. Make sure that the old gasket has not stuck to the mounting surface. If it has, remove it before installing the new filter.
c. Smear a little engine oil on the rubber gasket of the new oil filter.

## Page 152

d. Screw the new filter into place and tighten it until the gasket contacts the seat. Then give it additional 3/4 turn to seat the filter.

e. Reinstall the drain plug and gasket. Tighten the plug with your wrench, but do not force it and strip the threads.

---

4. Add oil and install the filler cap. Start the engine and check for leaks at the filter or drain plug.

a. See "Checking engine oil level" for proper engine oil selection. Engine oil additives are neither needed nor recommended.

b. After adding the oil, make sure that the filler cap is installed hand-tight. You should double-check the oil level on the dipstick.

c. With the engine running, look carefully for any small leaks from around the oil filter or drain plug. Any leak indicates a faulty installation.

d. Turn the engine off and wait a few minutes. Check the oil level again and add oil if necessary.

---

CAUTION:

- Used engine oil contains potentially harmful contaminants which may cause skin disorders such as inflammation or skin cancer, so care should be taken to avoid prolonged and repeated contact with it. To remove used engine oil from your skin, wash thoroughly with soap and water.

- Do not leave used oil within the reach of children.

- Dispose of used oil only in a safe and acceptable manner. Do not dispose of used oil in household trash, in sewers or onto the ground. Call your dealer or a service station for information concerning recycling or disposal.

## Checking the engine coolant level

Look at the see-through coolant reservoir tank. The coolant level is satisfactory if it is between the "FULL" and "LOW" lines on the tank. If the level is low, add ethylene-glycol type coolant.

The coolant level in the reservoir tank will vary with engine temperature. However, if the level is on or below the "LOW" line, add coolant. Bring the level up to the "FULL" line.

Use only ethylene-glycol type coolant. It will prevent freezing and corrosion. Supplemental inhibitors or additives are neither needed nor recommended. (For information on ethylene-glycol coolant, see also "Winter driving tips" in Part 3.)

If the coolant level drops within a short time after replenishing, there may be a leak in the system. Visually check the radiator, hoses, radiator cap and drain cock, and water pump.

If no leak can be found, have the cap pressure tested at your Toyota dealer.

**CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

To prevent burning yourself, do not remove the radiator cap when the engine is hot.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Changing the engine coolant

(RADIATOR DRAIN PLUG) (ENGINE DRAIN PLUG)

1. Drain the cooling system and flush it out with water.

a. Park the vehicle on a level spot, where the coolant can drain into a suitable disposal container.

b. Remove the radiator cap and loosen (turn counterclockwise) the two drain plugs.

**CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

To prevent burning yourself, do not remove the radiator cap or loosen the drain plugs if the engine is hot.

# 2. Close the two drain plugs and fill the system with ethylene-glycol coolant and water. Install the radiator cap.

a. Make sure that both drain plugs are securely tightened.

b. Read the ethylene-glycol container for information on freeze protection. Follow the manufacturer's directions for how much to mix with water. The total capacity of the cooling system is given in Part 8. We recommend more than 50 % solution (but no more than 70 %) be used for your Toyota, or a sufficient quantity to provide protection to about −31°F (−35°C).

c. Pour the ethylene-glycol coolant into the radiator. Then fill with clean water until the radiator is full.

d. Wait for a few minutes and add water again in small quantities until the water level does not drop.

e. Start the engine, and top off the radiator with water. Fill the reservoir half full.

f. Install the radiator and reservoir caps and double-check that the drain plugs are not leaking.

**NOTICE:**

If you spill some of the coolant, be sure to wash off with water to prevent it from damaging the parts or painting.

2. Unscrew and remove the old spark plugs.

a. Unscrew the plugs with a spark plug wrench.

b. Keep the plugs in order as you remove them. If the plug condition is normal, discard the plugs. One clue to judging the plug condition is the deposits. If the plugs have anything other than brown to light tan (or grey) deposits on them, that may indicate the engine needs adjustments or repairs. Save them and show them to your Toyota dealer.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
The spark plugs may be hot, so be careful.

---

**NOTICE:**

Do not allow dirt or anything else to fall through the spark plug holes.

---

3. Set the gap on the new plugs to the correct clearance, and install them. Reconnect the spark plug cables in the correct order.

a. Check the gap by passing the feeler gauge between the electrodes on the spark plug. If the gap is correct, you will feel a slight drag. If necessary, bend the outer electrode to obtain the right clearance.

b. Screw in the plugs by hand as far as it will go. If necessary, a spark plug wrench may be used for an extension. If a plug does not screw in smoothly, remove it and try again to ensure the correct engagement of the threads on the spark plug with the threads in the hole. This prevents the threads from stripping in the next step.

c. Tighten the plugs with a spark plug wrench. Do not overtighten.

d. Make sure the cables are installed in the correct order. The connector fastens on by pushing it squarely over the end of the plug.

**NOTICE:**

When adjusting the gap, do not pry the outer electrode against the center electrode.

**Spark plug selection**

Always use the spark plugs recommended below or equivalent.

- Nippondenso — W16EXR-U  
- NGK — BPR5EY

**NOTICE:**

Use only the spark plugs of the noted type. The use of the other plugs will cause engine damage, loss of performance or radio noises.

![BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR](60220101)

To check the fluid level, simply look at the see-through reservoir. The level should be within 0.4 in. (10 mm) below the "MAX" line.

It is normal for the brake fluid level to go down slightly as the brake pads wear. So be sure to keep the reservoirs filled.

If the reservoir needs frequent refilling, it may indicate a serious mechanical problem.

![Reservoir being filled](60220102)

If the level is low, add SAE J1703 or DOT 3 brake fluid to the brake reservoir.

Remove and replace the reservoir cover by hand. Fill the brake fluid to the dotted line. This brings the fluid to the correct level when you put the cover back on.

Do not use brake fluid that has been opened for more than 1 year or that has had the cap left off. Brake fluid absorbs moisture from the air, and excess moisture can cause a dangerous loss of braking.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Use caution in filling the reservoir because brake fluid can harm your eyes and damage painted surfaces.

# Checking the brake booster

Sit in the driver's seat and follow the instruction given below. If your brakes do not operate as described, have them checked at your Toyota dealer.

1. With the engine stopped, depress the brake pedal several times: the travel distance should not change.  
2. With the brake fully depressed, start the engine: the pedal should move down a little when the engine starts.  
3. Depress the brake, stop the engine, and hold the pedal in for about 30 seconds: the pedal should neither sink nor rise.  
4. Restart the engine, run it for about a minute and turn it off. Then firmly depress the brake several times: the pedal travel should decrease with each application.

# Checking power steering fluid

Check the fluid level on the dipstick. If necessary, add DEXRON® or DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid.

If the vehicle has been driven around 50 mph (80 km/h) for 20 minutes (a little more in frigid temperatures), the fluid is hot (140°F–175°F or 60°C–80°C). You may also check the level when the fluid is cold (about room temperature, 50°F–85°F or 10°C–30°C) if the engine has not been run for about five hours.

a. Clean all dirt from outside of the reservoir tank.

b. Remove the filler cap by turning it counterclockwise and wipe the dipstick clean.

c. Reinstall the filler cap.

d. Remove the filler cap again and look at the fluid level. If the fluid is cold, the level should be in the "COLD" range on the dipstick. Similarly, if it is hot, the fluid level should be in the "HOT" range. If the level is at the low side of either range, add DEXRON® or DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid to bring the level within the range.

e. After replacing the filler cap, visually check the steering box case, vane pump and hose connections for leaks or damage.

# Checking automatic transmission fluid

- (Image labels: P, L)

1. Check the fluid level only when the transmission is hot (normal operating temperature). With the vehicle level, first set the parking brake and then start the engine. While the engine is idling, depress the brake pedal and shift the selector lever into each range from "P" to "L" and return to "P".

If the vehicle has been driven over 10 miles or 16 km (15 miles or 24 km in frigid temperatures) and the fluid temperature is 160°F—175°F (70°C—80°C), the transmission is hot.

You may check the level when the transmission is cold. If the vehicle has not been driven for over five hours and the fluid is about room temperature 70°F—85°F (20°C—30°C), the transmission is cold.

However, checking a cold transmission is to be used for your reference only and the transmission must be checked again for correct level at normal operating temperature.

If the vehicle has just been driven for a long time at high speed or in city traffic in hot weather, or if the vehicle has been pulling a trailer, the accurate fluid level cannot be obtained. Check the level after the fluid has cooled down (about 30 minutes).

- (Image labels: LEVEL DIPSTICK, STOPPER)

2. With the engine still idling, check the fluid level and condition on the dipstick. If necessary, add DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid.

a. Pull out the dipstick with the stopper released and wipe it clean.

b. Reinsert the dipstick—push it in as far as it will go.

c. Pull the dipstick out and look at the fluid level. If the transmission is cold, the level should be in the "COOL" range on the dipstick. Similarly, if it is hot, the fluid level should be in the "HOT" range. If the level is at the low side of either range, add DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid to bring the level within the range. (Fluid is added through the dipstick tube, using a funnel.)

# Checking tire pressure

The recommended cold tire pressures, tire size and the vehicle capacity weight are given in Part 8.

You should check the tire pressures at least once a month. And don't forget the spare! The pressure for the spare tire should be 4 psi (0.3 kg/cm², 30 kPa) above the recommended cold tire pressure. Incorrect tire pressure can reduce tire life and make your vehicle less safe to drive.

Low tire pressure results in excessive wear, poor handling, reduced fuel economy, and the possibility of blowouts from overheated tires. Also, low tire pressure can cause poor sealing of the tire bead. If the tire pressure is excessively low, there is the possibility of wheel deformation and/or tire separation. So keep your tire pressures at the proper level. If a tire frequently needs refilling, have it checked by your Toyota dealer.

High tire pressure produces a harsh ride, handling problems, excessive wear at the center of the tire tread, and a greater possibility of tire damage from road hazards.

The following instructions for checking tire pressure should be observed:

cruisercult.com

165

![Page 165](images/page-165.jpg)

---

## Page 166

- The pressure should be checked only when the tires are cold. If your vehicle has been parked for at least 3 hours and has not been driven for more than 1 mile or 1.5 km since, you will get an accurate cold tire pressure reading.

- Always use a tire pressure gauge. The appearance of tire can be misleading. Besides, tire pressures that are even just a few pounds off can degrade handling and ride.

- Do not bleed or reduce tire pressure after driving. It is normal for the tire pressure to be higher after driving.

- Never exceed the vehicle capacity weight. The passenger and luggage weight should be located so that the vehicle is balanced.

- Be sure to reinstall the tire inflation valve caps. Without the valve caps, dirt or moisture could get into the valve core and cause air leakage. If the caps have been lost, have new ones put on as soon as possible.

# Rotating tires

[RADIAL TIRES]

4-WHEEL    5-WHEEL

70030-02

To equalize the wear of your tires, rotate the tires every 7500 miles (12000 km).

Including the spare tire in your rotation will cause your tires to last longer.

When rotating tires, check for uneven wear and damage. Abnormal wear is usually caused by incorrect tire pressure, improper wheel alignment, out-of-balance wheels, or severe braking.

After rotation, be sure to bring the front and rear tire pressures to specification and check wheel nut tightness.

Before storing radial, snow or studded tires, mark the direction of rotation and be sure to install them in the same direction when replacing. Tires should be stored in a cool dry place.

# Checking and replacing tires

**TREAD WEAR INDICATOR**

NEW TREAD

WORN TREAD

70040F01

---

## WHEN TO REPLACE YOUR TIRES

Replace the tires when the tread wear indicators show.

The tires on your Toyota have built-in tread wear indicators to help you know when the tires need replacement. When the tread depth wears to 0.06 in. (1.6 mm) or less, the indicators will appear. If you can see the indicators in two or more adjacent grooves, the tire should be replaced.

The effectiveness of snow and studded tires is lost if the tread wears down below 0.16 in. (4 mm).

---

If you have tire damage such as cuts, splits, cracks deep enough to expose the fabric, and bulges indicating internal damage, the tire should be replaced.

If a tire often goes flat or cannot be properly repaired due to the size or location of a cut or other damage, it should be replaced. If you are not sure, consult with a technician.

If an air loss occurs while driving, do not continue driving with a deflated tire. Driving even a short distance can damage a tire beyond repair.

If you have used an aerosol-type sealant for a temporary repair, a permanent vulcanized repair should be made as soon as possible.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not drive more than 100 miles (160 km) and over 50 mph (80 km/h) with a temporary repair.

---

70040-02

## TIRE SELECTION

When replacing a tire, use only the same size and construction as originally installed and with the same or greater load capacity.

Using any other size or type of tire may seriously affect handling, ride, speedometer/odometer calibration, ground clearance, and clearance between the body and tires or snow chains.

Do not mix radial, belted, or conventional tires on your vehicle.

It can cause dangerous handling characteristics, resulting in loss of control. If you need to change from conventional tires to radial tires or vice versa, replace them as a set.

cruisercult.com

167

![Page 167](images/page-167.jpg)

---

## Page 168

## TIRE INSTALLATION

If you need to replace the tires due to wear or damage, the following precautions should be observed when mounting the tire on the wheel.

- Lubricate wheel and tire beads with soapy water or tire mounting lubricant. Be careful in preventing tires from coming into contact with oil or gasoline.

- Fit the tire to the rim by inflating the tire to the pressure of 50 — 56 psi (3.5 — 4.0 kg/ cm², 340 — 390 kPa). After making sure that the tire is properly seated, adjust the inflation to the normal pressure recommended in Part 8.

- If the tire is not properly seated, deflate it, separate it from the rim and try again.

When a tire is replaced, the wheel should always be balanced.

An unbalanced wheel may affect vehicle handling and tire life. Wheels can get out of balance with regular use and should therefore be balanced occasionally.

When replacing a tubeless tire, the air valve should also be replaced with a new one.

---

## Installing snow tires and chains

### WHEN TO USE SNOW TIRES OR CHAINS

Snow tires or chains are recommended when driving on snow or ice to avoid high fuel consumption caused by spinning wheels.

On wet or dry roads, conventional or radial tires provide better traction than snow or studded tires.

### SNOW TIRE SELECTION

If you need snow tires, select the same size, construction and load capacity as the original tires on your Toyota.

Do not use other tires than stated above. Since your vehicle has radial tires as original equipment, make sure your snow tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without first checking local regulations for possible restrictions.

### SNOW TIRE INSTALLATION

Snow tires should be installed on all wheels.

Installing snow tires only on the rear wheels can lead to an excessive difference in road grip capability between the front and rear tires, which could cause loss of vehicle control.

---

### CAUTION:

Never drive over 75 mph (120 km/h) with any type of snow tires.

---

### TIRE CHAIN SELECTION

Regulations regarding the use of tire chains vary according to location or type of road, so always check them before installing chains.

### CHAIN INSTALLATION

When installing chains on your tires, carefully follow the instructions of the chain manufacturer.

The chain band will scratch the wheel covers so remove the covers, if equipped, before putting on the chains.

Install the chains as tightly as possible. When two-wheel driving, install the chains on the rear wheels. Do not use them on the front tires. When four-wheel driving, install them on the rear and/or front wheels. Retighten chains after driving 1/4 — 1/2 mile (0.5 — 1.0 km).

# Replacing wheels

## WHEN TO REPLACE YOUR WHEELS

If you have wheel damage such as bends, cracks or heavy corrosion, the wheel should be replaced.

If you fail to replace damaged wheels, the tire may slip off the wheel or they may cause loss of handling control.

Replacement with used wheels is not recommended as they may have been subjected to rough treatment or high mileage and could fail without warning. Also, bent wheels which have been straightened may have structural damage and therefore should not be used. Never use an inner tube in a leaking wheel which is designed for a tubeless tire.

### WHEEL SELECTION

When replacing wheels for some reason, care should be taken to ensure that the wheels are equivalent to those removed in load capacity, diameter, rim width, and offset.

Correct replacement wheels are available at your Toyota dealer.

A wheel of a different size or type may adversely affect handling, wheel and bearing life, brake cooling, speedometer/odometer calibration, stopping ability, headlight aim, bumper height, vehicle ground clearance, and tire or snow chain clearance to the body and chassis.

---

**CAUTION:**  
- Do not exceed 30 mph (50 km/h) or the chain manufacturer's recommended speed limit, whichever is lower.  
- Drive carefully avoiding bumps, holes, and sharp turns, which may cause the vehicle to bounce.  
- Avoid sharp turns or locked-wheel braking, as use of chains may adversely affect vehicle handling.

## 2. Check the electrolyte level as shown above. If the level is low, add distilled water.

a. When checking the electrolyte level, look at all six cells, not just one or two.

b. Remove the filler caps and replenish the battery with distilled water.

c. After replenishing, be sure to securely retighten the filler caps.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not overfill the battery or the electrolyte may squirt out of the battery during periods of heavy charging, causing corrosion or damage.

---

# Battery recharging precautions

During recharging, the battery is producing hydrogen gas.

Therefore, before recharging:

1. Remove the filler caps if performing a quick charge (6 A or above but max. 15 A). Removing the filler caps is not necessary when performing a slow charge (under 5 A).

2. Be sure the power switch on the recharger is off when connecting the charger cables to the battery and when disconnecting them.

3. If recharging with the battery installed on the vehicle, be sure to disconnect the ground cable.

**CAUTION:**  
Always charge the battery in an unconfined area. Do not charge the battery in a garage or closed room where there is not sufficient ventilation.

**NOTICE:**  
Never recharge the battery while the engine is running. Also, be sure all accessories are turned off.

# Checking and replacing fuses

(Pull-out tool / spare fuses illustration)
PULL-OUT TOOL  
SPARE FUSES  
60190102

1. Turn the ignition switch off and open the fuse box lid.  
If any light or electrical component does not work, your vehicle may have a blown fuse.  
Determine which fuse may be causing the problem. The lid of the fuse box shows the name of the circuit for each fuse. (If necessary, Part 8 gives the name of the circuit for each fuse.)

2. Be sure the inoperative component is off. Pull a suspected fuse straight out with the pull-out tool and check it. If it has blown, push a new fuse into the clips.  
60190F07

a. Look carefully at the fuse. If the thin wire is broken, the fuse has blown. If you are not sure or if it is too dark to see, try replacing the suspected fuse with one that you know is good.  
b. Install only a fuse with an amperage rating designated on the fuse box lid.

(Good / Blown fuse illustration)  
GOOD           BLOWN

If you do not have a spare fuse, in an emergency you can pull out the "CIG", "RADIO", "DOME", "A/C" or "HEATER" fuse, which may be dispensable for normal driving, and use it if its amperage rating is the same.

If you cannot use one of the same amperage, use one with a lower than, but as close as possible to, the same rating. If the amperage is lower than that specified, the fuse might blow out again but this does not indicate anything wrong. Be sure to get a correct fuse as soon as possible and return the substitute to its original clips.

It is a good idea to purchase a set of spare fuses and keep them in your vehicle for emergencies.

# Checking the circuit breakers

If the new fuse immediately blows out, there is a problem with the electrical system. Have your Toyota dealer correct it as soon as possible.

**NOTICE:**

Never use a fuse with a higher amperage rating nor some other object in place of a fuse.

In event the environmental control system, power windows or power door locks does not operate, check its circuit breaker (C.B).

To reset the circuit breaker, first turn the ignition switch off and carefully insert a thin object, such as a toothpick, needle or safety pin, into the hole in the circuit breaker until you hear a click. The component should now operate. This may be done without removing the circuit breaker.

If the circuit breaker immediately goes off again or the component does not operate, turn off the component switch and have the electrical system checked by your Toyota dealer as soon as possible.

If necessary, Part 8 gives the name of the circuit for each circuit breaker.

# Checking the fusible links

![FUSIBLE LINKS](6020101)

If the headlights or other electrical components do not work and the fuses are O.K., check the fusible links. If any of the links is melted, it must be replaced.

If there is an overload in the circuits from the battery, the fusible links are designed to melt before the entire wiring harness is damaged.

**NOTICE:**

Before replacing the fusible links, have the cause of electrical overload determined and repaired by your Toyota dealer.

Always use a genuine Toyota fusible link or equivalent for replacement. Never install a wire — even for a temporary fix. It may cause extensive damage and possibly a fire.

# Adding washer fluid

(WINDSHIELD WASHER OR HEADLIGHT CLEANER FLUID TANK)

If any washer does not work, the washer tank may be empty. Add washer fluid.

You may use plain water as washer fluid. However, in cold area where temperatures range below the freezing point, use washer fluid containing antifreeze. This product is available at your Toyota dealer and most auto parts stores. Follow the manufacturer's directions for how much to mix with water.

**NOTICE:**  

Do not use engine antifreeze or any other substitute because it may damage your vehicle's paint.
