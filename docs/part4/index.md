# If your vehicle will not start—

## (a) Simple checks

Before making these checks, make sure that you have followed the correct starting procedure instructed in "How to start the engine" in Part 3 and that you have sufficient fuel.

If the engine is not turning over or is turning over too slowly—

1. Check that the battery terminals are tight and clean.
2. If the battery terminals are O.K., switch on the interior light.
3. If the light is out, dim or goes out when the starter is cranked, the battery is discharged. You may try jump starting. See "(c) Jump starting" for further instructions.

If the light is O.K., but the engine still will not start, it needs adjustment or repair. Call a Toyota dealer or qualified repair shop for assistance.

**NOTICE:**
Do not pull- or push-start the vehicle. It may damage the vehicle or cause a collision when the engine starts. Also the catalytic converter may overheat and become a fire hazard.

---

If the engine turns over at its normal speed but will not start—

1. Check that all the push-on connectors are tight at the ignition coil, distributor, and spark plugs.

   See Chapter 7-1 for locations of these parts.

2. If the connectors are O.K., the engine may be flooded because of repeated cranking. See "(b) Starting the flooded engine" for further instructions.

3. If the engine still will not start, it needs adjustment or repair. Call a Toyota dealer or qualified repair shop for assistance.

## (b) Starting the flooded engine

If the engine will not start, your engine may be flooded because of repeated cranking.

If this happens, turn the key to "START" with the accelerator pedal held down. Keep the key and accelerator pedal held down for 15 seconds and release them. Then try starting the engine with your foot off the accelerator pedal.

If the engine does not start after 15 seconds of cranking, release the key, wait a few minutes and try again.

**NOTICE:**
Do not crank for more than 15 seconds at a time.

## (c) Jump starting

To avoid serious personal injury and damage to your vehicle which might result from battery explosion, acid burns, electrical burns, or damaged electronic components, these instructions must be followed precisely.

If you are unsure about how to follow this procedure, we strongly recommend that you seek the help of a competent mechanic or towing service.

**CAUTION:**
- Batteries contain sulfuric acid, which is poisonous and corrosive.
- Wear protective safety glasses when jump starting, and avoid spilling acid on your skin, clothing, or vehicle.
- If you should accidentally get acid on yourself or in your eyes, remove any contaminated clothing and flush the affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention.
- If possible, continue to apply water with a sponge or cloth while enroute to the medical office.

If you are unsure about how to follow this procedure, we strongly recommend that you seek the help of a competent mechanic or towing service.

**CAUTION:**

- Batteries contain sulfuric acid, which is poisonous and corrosive. Wear protective safety glasses when jump starting, and avoid spilling acid on your skin, clothing, or vehicle. If you should accidentally get acid on yourself or in your eyes, remove any contaminated clothing and flush the affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. If possible, continue to apply water with a sponge or cloth while enroute to the medical office.

- The gas normally produced by a battery will explode if a flame or spark is brought near. Therefore, do not smoke or light a match while jump starting.

**NOTICE:**

The battery used for boosting must be 12-volt. Do not jump start unless you are sure that the booster battery is correct.

### JUMP STARTING PROCEDURE

1. If the booster battery is installed in another vehicle, make sure that the vehicles are not touching. Turn off all unnecessary lights and accessories.
2. Remove all the vent caps from the booster battery. Lay a cloth over the open vents on the booster battery. (This helps reduce the explosion hazard.)

   If the booster battery is an extended maintenance interval battery, it is not necessary to remove the filler caps.

3. If the engine in the vehicle with the booster battery is not running, start it and let it run for a few minutes. During jumping run the engine at about 2000 rpm with the accelerator pedal lightly depressed.

# 4. Connect the jumper cables in the exact order shown in the illustration: positive-to-positive(+), and negative-to-engine or body ground(–). Note that you first connect the positive cable to the discharged battery and then to the booster battery. Next, connect the negative cable to the booster battery and then to a solid, stationary, metallic point (e.g. engine hanging hook) away from the battery. Do not connect it to or near any part that moves when the engine is cranked.

**NOTICE:**
When making the connections, do not lean over the battery or accidentally let the jumper cables or clamps touch anything except the correct battery terminals or the ground.

5. Start your engine in the normal way. After starting, run it at about 2000 rpm for several minutes with the accelerator pedal lightly depressed.

6. Carefully disconnect the cables in the exact reverse order: the negative cable and then the positive cable.

7. Carefully dispose of the battery cover cloths — they may now contain sulfuric acid.

8. Replace all the battery vent caps.

If the cause of your battery discharging is not apparent (for example, lights left on), you should have it checked.

# If your vehicle overheats

If your temperature gauge indicates overheating, if you experience a loss of power, or if you hear a loud knocking or pinging noise, the engine has probably overheated. You should follow this procedure...

1. Pull safely off the road, stop the vehicle, put the transmission in “P” and apply the parking brake. Turn off the air conditioner if it is being used.

2. If coolant or steam is boiling out of the radiator or reservoir, stop the engine. Wait until the steam subsides before opening the hood. If there is no coolant boiling over or steam, leave the engine running.

3. Visually check to see if the engine drive belt (fan belt) is broken or loose. Look for obvious coolant leaks from the radiator, hoses, and under the vehicle. However, note that water draining from the air conditioner is normal if it has been used.

**CAUTION:**
When the engine is running, keep hands and clothing away from the moving fan and engine drive belts.

4. If the engine drive belt is broken or the coolant is leaking, stop the engine immediately. Call a Toyota dealer for assistance.

5. If the engine drive belt is O.K. and there are no obvious leaks, you may help the engine cool down more quickly by running it at about 1500 rpm for a few minutes with the accelerator pedal lightly depressed.

6. Check the coolant reservoir. If it is dry, add water to the reservoir while the engine is running. Fill it about half full.

**CAUTION:**
Do not attempt to remove the radiator cap when the engine and radiator are hot. Serious injury could result from scalding hot fluid and steam blown out under pressure.

7. After the engine temperature has cooled to normal, again check the coolant level in the reservoir. If necessary, bring it up to half full again. Serious coolant loss indicates a leak in the system. You should have it checked as soon as possible at your Toyota dealer.

# If you have a flat tire—

1. Make sure you are completely off the road — well away from the traffic. Avoid stopping on the center divider of a highway. Park on a level spot with firm ground.

2. Stop the engine and turn on your emergency flashers.

3. Firmly set the parking brake and put the transmission in “P”.

4. Have everyone get out of the vehicle on the side away from traffic.

5. Read the following instructions thoroughly. They are designed to help a person who has never before changed a tire.

**CAUTION:**
When jacking, be sure to observe the following to reduce the possibility of personal injury:

- Follow jacking instructions.
- Use a jack only for lifting your vehicle during wheel changing.
- Never get beneath the vehicle when supported by a jack.
- Do not start or run the engine while your vehicle is supported by a jack.

— Blocking the wheel
![illustration]

2. Block the wheel diagonally opposite the flat tire to keep the vehicle from rolling when it is jacked up.

When blocking the wheel, place the wheel block from the front for the front wheels or from the rear for the rear wheels.

— Removing wheel ornament
![illustration]

3. Remove the wheel ornament.
Pry off the wheel ornament, using the beveled end of the wheel ornament remover as shown. To avoid personal injury, do not attempt to pull off the ornament by hand.

— Loosening wheel nuts
![illustration]

4. Loosen all the wheel nuts.
Always loosen the wheel nuts before raising the vehicle.

The nuts turn counterclockwise to loosen. To get maximum leverage, fit the wrench to the nut so that the handle is on the right side, as shown above. Grab the wrench near the end of the handle and pull up on the handle. Be careful that the wrench does not slip off the nut.

Do not remove the nuts yet — just unscrew them about one-half turn.

To remove the spare tire;
1. Insert the end of the jack handle extension into the lowering screw and turn it counter-clockwise with the handle.
2. After the tire is lowered completely to the ground, remove the holding bracket.
When storing the spare tire, put it into place with the outer side of the wheel facing up. Then secure the tire, being careful that the tire rises straight up without catching on any other part, to prevent it from flying forward during a collision or sudden braking.

## — Positioning the jack

5. Position the jack at the correct jack point as shown.  
Make sure that the jack is positioned on a level and solid place.

JACK POINTS:  
Front —  
Under the front axle housing between the leaf spring and stabilizer bar  
Rear —  
Under the rear axle housing near the wheel to be raised

---

## — Raising your vehicle

6. After making sure that no one is in the vehicle, raise it high enough so that the spare tire can be installed.  
Remember that you will need more ground clearance when putting on the spare tire than when removing the flat tire.

To raise the vehicle, insert the jack handle extension into the jack (it is a loose fit) and turn it clockwise with the handle. As the jack touches the vehicle and begins to lift, double-check that it is properly positioned.

CAUTION:  
Never get under the vehicle when it is supported by the jack alone.

## — Changing wheels

30140-01

7. Remove the wheel nuts and change tires.

Lift the flat tire straight off and put it aside.

Roll the spare wheel into position and align the holes in the wheel with the bolts. Then lift up the wheel and get at least the top bolt started through its hole. Wiggle the tire and press it back over the other bolts.

30140-02

Before putting on wheels, remove any corrosion on the mounting surfaces with a wire brush or such. Installation of wheels without good metal-to-metal contact at the mounting surface can cause wheel nuts to loosen, and eventually cause a wheel to come off while driving. Therefore after the first 1000 miles (1600 km), check to see that the wheel nuts are tight.

## — Reinstalling wheel nuts

30150-01

8. Reinstall all the wheel nuts finger tight.

Reinstall the wheel nuts and tighten them as much as you can by hand. Press the tire back and see if you can tighten them more.

## — Lowering your vehicle

30106001

TIGHTENING TORQUE:  
116 ft-lb (16 kg-m, 157 N.m)

TIGHTEN

9. Lower the vehicle completely and tighten the wheel nuts.

Turn the jack handle counterclockwise to lower the vehicle.

Use only the wheel nut wrench to tighten the nuts. Do not use other tools or any additional leverage other than your hands, such as a hammer, pipe or your foot. Make sure the wrench is securely engaged over the nut.

Tighten each nut a little at a time in the order shown. Repeat the process until all the nuts are tight.

As soon as possible after changing wheels, have a technician tighten the wheel nuts to the proper torque with a torque wrench.
