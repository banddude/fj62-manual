# Checking battery condition and fluid level

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## BATTERY PRECAUTIONS

The battery produces an inflammable and explosive hydrogen gas.
- Do not cause a spark from the battery with tools.
- Do not smoke or light a match near the battery.

The electrolyte contains poisonous and corrosive sulfuric acid.
- Avoid contact with eyes, skin or clothes.
- Never ingest electrolyte.
- Wear protective safety glasses when working near the battery.
- Keep children away from the battery.

## EMERGENCY MEASURES
- If electrolyte gets in your eyes, flush your eyes with clean water for at least 15 minutes and get immediate medical attention. If possible, continue to apply water with a sponge or cloth while enroute to the medical office.
- If electrolyte gets on your skin, thoroughly wash the contacted area. If you feel a pain or burn, get medical attention immediately.
- If electrolyte gets on your clothes, there is a possibility of its soaking through to your skin, so immediately take off the exposed clothing and follow the procedure above, if necessary.
- If you happen to swallow electrolyte, drink a large quantity of water or milk. Follow with milk of magnesia, beaten raw egg or vegetable oil. Then go immediately for emergency help.

TERMINALS

HOLD-DOWN CLAMP

1. Check the battery for corroded or loose connections, cracks, or loose hold-down clamps.

a. If the battery is corroded, wash it off with a solution of warm water and baking soda. Coat the outside of the terminals with grease to prevent further corrosion.

b. If the connections are loose, tighten the clamp bolts — but do not overtighten.

c. Tighten the hold-down clamp only enough to keep the battery firmly in place. Overtightening may damage the battery case.

# NOTICE

Be sure the engine and all accessories are off before performing maintenance.

Remove the ground cable first and reinstall last.

Be careful not to cause a short circuit with tools.

![Battery diagram showing electrolyte level](image)

*Electrolyte (clear fluid) must be between upper and lower lines*  
(60170-09)

## 2. Check the electrolyte level as shown above. If the level is low, add distilled water.

a. When checking the electrolyte level, look at all six cells, not just one or two.

b. Remove the filler caps and replenish the battery with distilled water.

c. After replenishing, be sure to securely retighten the filler caps.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not overfill the battery or the electrolyte may squirt out of the battery during periods of heavy charging, causing corrosion or damage.

---

# Battery recharging precautions

During recharging, the battery is producing hydrogen gas.

Therefore, before recharging:

1. Remove the filler caps if performing a quick charge (6 A or above but max. 15 A). Removing the filler caps is not necessary when performing a slow charge (under 5 A).

2. Be sure the power switch on the recharger is off when connecting the charger cables to the battery and when disconnecting them.

3. If recharging with the battery installed on the vehicle, be sure to disconnect the ground cable.

**CAUTION:**  
Always charge the battery in an unconfined area. Do not charge the battery in a garage or closed room where there is not sufficient ventilation.

**NOTICE:**  
Never recharge the battery while the engine is running. Also, be sure all accessories are turned off.

# Checking and replacing fuses

(Pull-out tool / spare fuses illustration)
PULL-OUT TOOL  
SPARE FUSES  
60190102

1. Turn the ignition switch off and open the fuse box lid.  
If any light or electrical component does not work, your vehicle may have a blown fuse.  
Determine which fuse may be causing the problem. The lid of the fuse box shows the name of the circuit for each fuse. (If necessary, Part 8 gives the name of the circuit for each fuse.)

2. Be sure the inoperative component is off. Pull a suspected fuse straight out with the pull-out tool and check it. If it has blown, push a new fuse into the clips.  
60190F07

a. Look carefully at the fuse. If the thin wire is broken, the fuse has blown. If you are not sure or if it is too dark to see, try replacing the suspected fuse with one that you know is good.  
b. Install only a fuse with an amperage rating designated on the fuse box lid.

(Good / Blown fuse illustration)  
GOOD           BLOWN  
60190F08

If you do not have a spare fuse, in an emergency you can pull out the "CIG", "RADIO", "DOME", "A/C" or "HEATER" fuse, which may be dispensable for normal driving, and use it if its amperage rating is the same.

If you cannot use one of the same amperage, use one with a lower than, but as close as possible to, the same rating. If the amperage is lower than that specified, the fuse might blow out again but this does not indicate anything wrong. Be sure to get a correct fuse as soon as possible and return the substitute to its original clips.

It is a good idea to purchase a set of spare fuses and keep them in your vehicle for emergencies.

# Checking the circuit breakers

If the new fuse immediately blows out, there is a problem with the electrical system. Have your Toyota dealer correct it as soon as possible.

**NOTICE:**

Never use a fuse with a higher amperage rating nor some other object in place of a fuse.

In event the environmental control system, power windows or power door locks does not operate, check its circuit breaker (C.B).

To reset the circuit breaker, first turn the ignition switch off and carefully insert a thin object, such as a toothpick, needle or safety pin, into the hole in the circuit breaker until you hear a click. The component should now operate. This may be done without removing the circuit breaker.

If the circuit breaker immediately goes off again or the component does not operate, turn off the component switch and have the electrical system checked by your Toyota dealer as soon as possible.

If necessary, Part 8 gives the name of the circuit for each circuit breaker.

# Checking the fusible links

![FUSIBLE LINKS](6020101)

If the headlights or other electrical components do not work and the fuses are O.K., check the fusible links. If any of the links is melted, it must be replaced.

If there is an overload in the circuits from the battery, the fusible links are designed to melt before the entire wiring harness is damaged.

**NOTICE:**

Before replacing the fusible links, have the cause of electrical overload determined and repaired by your Toyota dealer.

Always use a genuine Toyota fusible link or equivalent for replacement. Never install a wire — even for a temporary fix. It may cause extensive damage and possibly a fire.

# Replacing the windshield wiper blades

![REPLACEMENT HOLE](60270F01) ![PROTRUSIONS](60270F02)

When the wipers no longer clean adequately, the wiper blades may be worn or cracked requiring replacement.

a. Pull the top end of the rubber inward until the rubber blade is free of the end slot, and you can see the replacement hole.

b. Pull the rubber blade out the replacement hole.

c. To install a new rubber, insert the end with small protrusions into the replacement hole, and work the rubber along the slot in the blade frame.

d. Once all of the rubber is in the frame slot, allow it to expand and fill in the end.

**NOTICE:**

Be careful not to scratch the window face with the wiper frame.

# Replacing the rear wiper blade

(REPLACEMENT HOLE)

When the wiper no longer cleans adequately, the wiper blade may be worn or cracked requiring replacement.

a. Pull the top end of the rubber inward until the rubber blade is free of the end slot, and you can see the replacement hole.  
b. Pull the rubber blade out the replacement hole.

c. Insert the end of a new rubber into the hole, and work the rubber along the slot in the blade frame.  
d. Once all of the rubber is in the frame slot, allow it to expand and fill in the end.

**NOTICE:**

# Adding washer fluid

(WINDSHIELD WASHER OR HEADLIGHT CLEANER FLUID TANK)

If any washer does not work, the washer tank may be empty. Add washer fluid.

You may use plain water as washer fluid. However, in cold area where temperatures range below the freezing point, use washer fluid containing antifreeze. This product is available at your Toyota dealer and most auto parts stores. Follow the manufacturer's directions for how much to mix with water.

**NOTICE:**  

Do not use engine antifreeze or any other substitute because it may damage your vehicle's paint.
