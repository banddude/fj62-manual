```
60040F01

With the engine at operating temperature and turned off, check the oil level on the dipstick.

1. To get a true reading, the vehicle should be on a level spot. After turning off the engine, wait a few minutes for the oil to drain back into the bottom of the engine.

2. Pull out the dipstick, and wipe it clean with a rag.

3. Reinsert the dipstick — push it in as far as it will go, or the reading will not be correct.

4. Pull the dipstick out and look at the oil level on the end. If it is between the "F" and "L" marks, it is O.K.

60050F04

If the oil level is below the "L" mark, add engine oil.

Remove the oil filler cap and add engine oil in small quantities at a time, checking the dipstick. If the level reaches within the correct range, install the filler cap hand-tight.

NOTICE:
Avoid overfilling, or the engine could be damaged.

## Engine oil selection

Use engine oil of API grade SF or SF/CC. Determine the viscosity considering your climate. Recommended viscosity is as follows. Using multigrade and fuel-efficient engine oil is recommended.

Recommended viscosity (SAE):

- 5W-30
- 10W-30
- 10W-40
- 10W-50
- 15W-40
- 20W-40
- 20W-50

# Changing the engine oil and filter

![60050F01]

1. Warm up the engine for a few minutes and then turn it off. Remove the oil filler cap.
a. Park the vehicle on a level spot. Warm up the engine until the engine temperature gauge shows a rise. (Warm oil will drain faster and more thoroughly.) Turn the engine off.
b. Remove the oil filler cap. This allows air to enter the engine as the oil drains.

![60050-04 LOOSEN]

2. Remove the drain plug and allow the oil to drain fully.
a. Place a drain pan under the drain plug.
b. Using a wrench, remove the drain plug. Allow the oil to drain fully.

CAUTION: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The oil may be hot—be careful not to burn yourself.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

![60050F03 LOOSEN]

3. Remove the old oil filter and install a new one hand-tight. Reinstall the drain plug.
a. Using an oil filter wrench (any of several common types will work), loosen the oil filter. It turns counterclockwise. Once loose, you may unscrew it the rest of the way by hand. When removing it, hold up the end so that oil does not spill out.
b. With a clean rag, wipe off the mounting surface on the engine so that the new filter will seat well. Make sure that the old gasket has not stuck to the mounting surface. If it has, remove it before installing the new filter.
c. Smear a little engine oil on the rubber gasket of the new oil filter.

## Page 152

d. Screw the new filter into place and tighten it until the gasket contacts the seat. Then give it additional 3/4 turn to seat the filter.

e. Reinstall the drain plug and gasket. Tighten the plug with your wrench, but do not force it and strip the threads.

---

4. Add oil and install the filler cap. Start the engine and check for leaks at the filter or drain plug.

a. See "Checking engine oil level" for proper engine oil selection. Engine oil additives are neither needed nor recommended.

b. After adding the oil, make sure that the filler cap is installed hand-tight. You should double-check the oil level on the dipstick.

c. With the engine running, look carefully for any small leaks from around the oil filter or drain plug. Any leak indicates a faulty installation.

d. Turn the engine off and wait a few minutes. Check the oil level again and add oil if necessary.

---

CAUTION:

- Used engine oil contains potentially harmful contaminants which may cause skin disorders such as inflammation or skin cancer, so care should be taken to avoid prolonged and repeated contact with it. To remove used engine oil from your skin, wash thoroughly with soap and water.

- Do not leave used oil within the reach of children.

- Dispose of used oil only in a safe and acceptable manner. Do not dispose of used oil in household trash, in sewers or onto the ground. Call your dealer or a service station for information concerning recycling or disposal.

## Checking the engine coolant level

Look at the see-through coolant reservoir tank. The coolant level is satisfactory if it is between the "FULL" and "LOW" lines on the tank. If the level is low, add ethylene-glycol type coolant.

The coolant level in the reservoir tank will vary with engine temperature. However, if the level is on or below the "LOW" line, add coolant. Bring the level up to the "FULL" line.

Use only ethylene-glycol type coolant. It will prevent freezing and corrosion. Supplemental inhibitors or additives are neither needed nor recommended. (For information on ethylene-glycol coolant, see also "Winter driving tips" in Part 3.)

If the coolant level drops within a short time after replenishing, there may be a leak in the system. Visually check the radiator, hoses, radiator cap and drain cock, and water pump.

If no leak can be found, have the cap pressure tested at your Toyota dealer.

**CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

To prevent burning yourself, do not remove the radiator cap when the engine is hot.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Changing the engine coolant

(RADIATOR DRAIN PLUG) (ENGINE DRAIN PLUG)

1. Drain the cooling system and flush it out with water.

a. Park the vehicle on a level spot, where the coolant can drain into a suitable disposal container.

b. Remove the radiator cap and loosen (turn counterclockwise) the two drain plugs.

**CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

To prevent burning yourself, do not remove the radiator cap or loosen the drain plugs if the engine is hot.

# 2. Close the two drain plugs and fill the system with ethylene-glycol coolant and water. Install the radiator cap.

a. Make sure that both drain plugs are securely tightened.

b. Read the ethylene-glycol container for information on freeze protection. Follow the manufacturer's directions for how much to mix with water. The total capacity of the cooling system is given in Part 8. We recommend more than 50 % solution (but no more than 70 %) be used for your Toyota, or a sufficient quantity to provide protection to about −31°F (−35°C).

c. Pour the ethylene-glycol coolant into the radiator. Then fill with clean water until the radiator is full.

d. Wait for a few minutes and add water again in small quantities until the water level does not drop.

e. Start the engine, and top off the radiator with water. Fill the reservoir half full.

f. Install the radiator and reservoir caps and double-check that the drain plugs are not leaking.

**NOTICE:**

If you spill some of the coolant, be sure to wash off with water to prevent it from damaging the parts or painting.

# Checking and replacing the air cleaner element

WINGNUT  
COVER  
CLIPS  
ELEMENT

To inspect the element, unscrew the wingnut and release the clips. Then remove the cover and take out the element.

The wingnut can be unscrewed by hand.

Pull the wire tab to release each clip.

Inspect the outer surface of the element. If it is dirty, it should be replaced. If it is just moderately dusty, it may be cleaned by blowing compressed air from the inside. Do not wash or oil the element.

When installing an element, be sure to remove any dust from where the element seats and put the element properly in place.

Do not overtighten the wingnut.

LOOSEN  
(60160-03)

**NOTICE:**  
Do not drive with the air cleaner removed, or excessive engine wear could result. Also backfiring could cause a fire in the engine compartment.

1. Unfasten the spark plug cables by pulling on the boot, not on the cable itself.

a. Note the order of the spark plug cables. If you are not positive that you can reconnect them correctly, mark each cable with a number on a piece of tape before disconnecting it.

b. Unfasten the connector by pulling straight up. Pulling on the cables may break the carbon conductor inside.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
The boots may be hot, so be careful.  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2. Unscrew and remove the old spark plugs.

a. Unscrew the plugs with a spark plug wrench.

b. Keep the plugs in order as you remove them. If the plug condition is normal, discard the plugs. One clue to judging the plug condition is the deposits. If the plugs have anything other than brown to light tan (or grey) deposits on them, that may indicate the engine needs adjustments or repairs. Save them and show them to your Toyota dealer.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
The spark plugs may be hot, so be careful.

# GAP: 0.031 in. (0.8 mm)

![illustration]

---

**NOTICE:**

Do not allow dirt or anything else to fall through the spark plug holes.

---

3. Set the gap on the new plugs to the correct clearance, and install them. Reconnect the spark plug cables in the correct order.

a. Check the gap by passing the feeler gauge between the electrodes on the spark plug. If the gap is correct, you will feel a slight drag. If necessary, bend the outer electrode to obtain the right clearance.

b. Screw in the plugs by hand as far as it will go. If necessary, a spark plug wrench may be used for an extension. If a plug does not screw in smoothly, remove it and try again to ensure the correct engagement of the threads on the spark plug with the threads in the hole. This prevents the threads from stripping in the next step.

c. Tighten the plugs with a spark plug wrench. Do not overtighten.

d. Make sure the cables are installed in the correct order. The connector fastens on by pushing it squarely over the end of the plug.

**NOTICE:**

When adjusting the gap, do not pry the outer electrode against the center electrode.

**Spark plug selection**

Always use the spark plugs recommended below or equivalent.

- Nippondenso — W16EXR-U  
- NGK — BPR5EY

**NOTICE:**

Use only the spark plugs of the noted type. The use of the other plugs will cause engine damage, loss of performance or radio noises.

![BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR](60220101)

To check the fluid level, simply look at the see-through reservoir. The level should be within 0.4 in. (10 mm) below the "MAX" line.

It is normal for the brake fluid level to go down slightly as the brake pads wear. So be sure to keep the reservoirs filled.

If the reservoir needs frequent refilling, it may indicate a serious mechanical problem.

![Reservoir being filled](60220102)

If the level is low, add SAE J1703 or DOT 3 brake fluid to the brake reservoir.

Remove and replace the reservoir cover by hand. Fill the brake fluid to the dotted line. This brings the fluid to the correct level when you put the cover back on.

Do not use brake fluid that has been opened for more than 1 year or that has had the cap left off. Brake fluid absorbs moisture from the air, and excess moisture can cause a dangerous loss of braking.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Use caution in filling the reservoir because brake fluid can harm your eyes and damage painted surfaces.

# Checking the brake booster

Sit in the driver's seat and follow the instruction given below. If your brakes do not operate as described, have them checked at your Toyota dealer.

1. With the engine stopped, depress the brake pedal several times: the travel distance should not change.  
2. With the brake fully depressed, start the engine: the pedal should move down a little when the engine starts.  
3. Depress the brake, stop the engine, and hold the pedal in for about 30 seconds: the pedal should neither sink nor rise.  
4. Restart the engine, run it for about a minute and turn it off. Then firmly depress the brake several times: the pedal travel should decrease with each application.

# Checking power steering fluid

Check the fluid level on the dipstick. If necessary, add DEXRON® or DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid.

If the vehicle has been driven around 50 mph (80 km/h) for 20 minutes (a little more in frigid temperatures), the fluid is hot (140°F–175°F or 60°C–80°C). You may also check the level when the fluid is cold (about room temperature, 50°F–85°F or 10°C–30°C) if the engine has not been run for about five hours.

a. Clean all dirt from outside of the reservoir tank.

b. Remove the filler cap by turning it counterclockwise and wipe the dipstick clean.

c. Reinstall the filler cap.

d. Remove the filler cap again and look at the fluid level. If the fluid is cold, the level should be in the "COLD" range on the dipstick. Similarly, if it is hot, the fluid level should be in the "HOT" range. If the level is at the low side of either range, add DEXRON® or DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid to bring the level within the range.

e. After replacing the filler cap, visually check the steering box case, vane pump and hose connections for leaks or damage.

# Checking automatic transmission fluid

- (Image labels: P, L)

1. Check the fluid level only when the transmission is hot (normal operating temperature). With the vehicle level, first set the parking brake and then start the engine. While the engine is idling, depress the brake pedal and shift the selector lever into each range from "P" to "L" and return to "P".

If the vehicle has been driven over 10 miles or 16 km (15 miles or 24 km in frigid temperatures) and the fluid temperature is 160°F—175°F (70°C—80°C), the transmission is hot.

You may check the level when the transmission is cold. If the vehicle has not been driven for over five hours and the fluid is about room temperature 70°F—85°F (20°C—30°C), the transmission is cold.

However, checking a cold transmission is to be used for your reference only and the transmission must be checked again for correct level at normal operating temperature.

If the vehicle has just been driven for a long time at high speed or in city traffic in hot weather, or if the vehicle has been pulling a trailer, the accurate fluid level cannot be obtained. Check the level after the fluid has cooled down (about 30 minutes).

- (Image labels: LEVEL DIPSTICK, STOPPER)

2. With the engine still idling, check the fluid level and condition on the dipstick. If necessary, add DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid.

a. Pull out the dipstick with the stopper released and wipe it clean.

b. Reinsert the dipstick—push it in as far as it will go.

c. Pull the dipstick out and look at the fluid level. If the transmission is cold, the level should be in the "COOL" range on the dipstick. Similarly, if it is hot, the fluid level should be in the "HOT" range. If the level is at the low side of either range, add DEXRON®-II automatic transmission fluid to bring the level within the range. (Fluid is added through the dipstick tube, using a funnel.)

# Checking tire pressure

The recommended cold tire pressures, tire size and the vehicle capacity weight are given in Part 8.

You should check the tire pressures at least once a month. And don't forget the spare! The pressure for the spare tire should be 4 psi (0.3 kg/cm², 30 kPa) above the recommended cold tire pressure. Incorrect tire pressure can reduce tire life and make your vehicle less safe to drive.

Low tire pressure results in excessive wear, poor handling, reduced fuel economy, and the possibility of blowouts from overheated tires. Also, low tire pressure can cause poor sealing of the tire bead. If the tire pressure is excessively low, there is the possibility of wheel deformation and/or tire separation. So keep your tire pressures at the proper level. If a tire frequently needs refilling, have it checked by your Toyota dealer.

High tire pressure produces a harsh ride, handling problems, excessive wear at the center of the tire tread, and a greater possibility of tire damage from road hazards.

The following instructions for checking tire pressure should be observed:

cruisercult.com

165

![Manual Page 165](../images/page-165.jpg)

---

## Page 166

- The pressure should be checked only when the tires are cold. If your vehicle has been parked for at least 3 hours and has not been driven for more than 1 mile or 1.5 km since, you will get an accurate cold tire pressure reading.

- Always use a tire pressure gauge. The appearance of tire can be misleading. Besides, tire pressures that are even just a few pounds off can degrade handling and ride.

- Do not bleed or reduce tire pressure after driving. It is normal for the tire pressure to be higher after driving.

- Never exceed the vehicle capacity weight. The passenger and luggage weight should be located so that the vehicle is balanced.

- Be sure to reinstall the tire inflation valve caps. Without the valve caps, dirt or moisture could get into the valve core and cause air leakage. If the caps have been lost, have new ones put on as soon as possible.

# Rotating tires

[RADIAL TIRES]

4-WHEEL    5-WHEEL

70030-02

To equalize the wear of your tires, rotate the tires every 7500 miles (12000 km).

Including the spare tire in your rotation will cause your tires to last longer.

When rotating tires, check for uneven wear and damage. Abnormal wear is usually caused by incorrect tire pressure, improper wheel alignment, out-of-balance wheels, or severe braking.

After rotation, be sure to bring the front and rear tire pressures to specification and check wheel nut tightness.

Before storing radial, snow or studded tires, mark the direction of rotation and be sure to install them in the same direction when replacing. Tires should be stored in a cool dry place.

## WHEN TO REPLACE YOUR TIRES

Replace the tires when the tread wear indicators show.

The tires on your Toyota have built-in tread wear indicators to help you know when the tires need replacement. When the tread depth wears to 0.06 in. (1.6 mm) or less, the indicators will appear. If you can see the indicators in two or more adjacent grooves, the tire should be replaced.

The effectiveness of snow and studded tires is lost if the tread wears down below 0.16 in. (4 mm).

If you have tire damage such as cuts, splits, cracks deep enough to expose the fabric, and bulges indicating internal damage, the tire should be replaced.

If a tire often goes flat or cannot be properly repaired due to the size or location of a cut or other damage, it should be replaced. If you are not sure, consult with a technician.

If an air loss occurs while driving, do not continue driving with a deflated tire. Driving even a short distance can damage a tire beyond repair.

If you have used an aerosol-type sealant for a temporary repair, a permanent vulcanized repair should be made as soon as possible.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not drive more than 100 miles (160 km) and over 50 mph (80 km/h) with a temporary repair.

## TIRE SELECTION

When replacing a tire, use only the same size and construction as originally installed and with the same or greater load capacity.

Using any other size or type of tire may seriously affect handling, ride, speedometer/odometer calibration, ground clearance, and clearance between the body and tires or snow chains.

Do not mix radial, belted, or conventional tires on your vehicle.

It can cause dangerous handling characteristics, resulting in loss of control. If you need to change from conventional tires to radial tires or vice versa, replace them as a set.

## TIRE INSTALLATION

If you need to replace the tires due to wear or damage, the following precautions should be observed when mounting the tire on the wheel.

- Lubricate wheel and tire beads with soapy water or tire mounting lubricant. Be careful in preventing tires from coming into contact with oil or gasoline.

- Fit the tire to the rim by inflating the tire to the pressure of 50 — 56 psi (3.5 — 4.0 kg/ cm², 340 — 390 kPa). After making sure that the tire is properly seated, adjust the inflation to the normal pressure recommended in Part 8.

- If the tire is not properly seated, deflate it, separate it from the rim and try again.

When a tire is replaced, the wheel should always be balanced.

An unbalanced wheel may affect vehicle handling and tire life. Wheels can get out of balance with regular use and should therefore be balanced occasionally.

When replacing a tubeless tire, the air valve should also be replaced with a new one.

## Installing snow tires and chains

### WHEN TO USE SNOW TIRES OR CHAINS

Snow tires or chains are recommended when driving on snow or ice to avoid high fuel consumption caused by spinning wheels.

On wet or dry roads, conventional or radial tires provide better traction than snow or studded tires.

### SNOW TIRE SELECTION

If you need snow tires, select the same size, construction and load capacity as the original tires on your Toyota.

Do not use other tires than stated above. Since your vehicle has radial tires as original equipment, make sure your snow tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without first checking local regulations for possible restrictions.

### SNOW TIRE INSTALLATION

Snow tires should be installed on all wheels.

Installing snow tires only on the rear wheels can lead to an excessive difference in road grip capability between the front and rear tires, which could cause loss of vehicle control.

---

### CAUTION:

Never drive over 75 mph (120 km/h) with any type of snow tires.

---

### TIRE CHAIN SELECTION

Regulations regarding the use of tire chains vary according to location or type of road, so always check them before installing chains.

### CHAIN INSTALLATION

When installing chains on your tires, carefully follow the instructions of the chain manufacturer.

The chain band will scratch the wheel covers so remove the covers, if equipped, before putting on the chains.

Install the chains as tightly as possible. When two-wheel driving, install the chains on the rear wheels. Do not use them on the front tires. When four-wheel driving, install them on the rear and/or front wheels. Retighten chains after driving 1/4 — 1/2 mile (0.5 — 1.0 km).

# Replacing wheels

## WHEN TO REPLACE YOUR WHEELS

If you have wheel damage such as bends, cracks or heavy corrosion, the wheel should be replaced.

If you fail to replace damaged wheels, the tire may slip off the wheel or they may cause loss of handling control.

Replacement with used wheels is not recommended as they may have been subjected to rough treatment or high mileage and could fail without warning. Also, bent wheels which have been straightened may have structural damage and therefore should not be used. Never use an inner tube in a leaking wheel which is designed for a tubeless tire.

### WHEEL SELECTION

When replacing wheels for some reason, care should be taken to ensure that the wheels are equivalent to those removed in load capacity, diameter, rim width, and offset.

Correct replacement wheels are available at your Toyota dealer.

A wheel of a different size or type may adversely affect handling, wheel and bearing life, brake cooling, speedometer/odometer calibration, stopping ability, headlight aim, bumper height, vehicle ground clearance, and tire or snow chain clearance to the body and chassis.

---

**CAUTION:**  
- Do not exceed 30 mph (50 km/h) or the chain manufacturer's recommended speed limit, whichever is lower.  
- Drive carefully avoiding bumps, holes, and sharp turns, which may cause the vehicle to bounce.  
- Avoid sharp turns or locked-wheel braking, as use of chains may adversely affect vehicle handling.
