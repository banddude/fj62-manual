# Do-it-yourself service precautions

If you perform maintenance by yourself, be sure to follow the correct procedure given in this part.

You should be aware that improper or incomplete servicing may result in operating problems.

Performing do-it-yourself maintenance during the warranty period may affect your warranty coverage. Read the separate Toyota Warranty statement for details and suggestions.

This part gives instructions only for those items that are relatively easy for an owner to perform. As explained in Part 6, there are still a number of items that must be done by a qualified technician with special tools.

For information on tools and parts for do-it-yourself maintenance, see "Parts and tools".

Utmost care should be taken when working on your vehicle to prevent accidental injury. Here are a few precautions that you should be especially careful to observe:

### CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- When the engine is running, keep hands, clothing, and tools away from the moving fan and engine drive belts. (Removing rings, watches, and ties is advisable.)

- Right after driving, the engine, radiator and exhaust manifold will be hot, so be careful not to touch them. Oil and fluid may also be hot.

- Do not smoke, cause sparks or allow open flames around fuel or battery. The fumes are inflammable.

- Be extremely cautious when working on the battery. It contains poisonous and corrosive sulfuric acid.

- Do not get under your vehicle with just the body jack supporting it. Always use automotive jack stands or other solid supports.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### NOTICE:

Remember that battery and ignition cables carry high currents or voltages. Be careful of accidentally causing a short circuit.

When closing the engine hood, check to see that you have not forgotten any tools, rags, etc.
