## — Adjusting seat position

Pull the lock release lever sideways. Then slide the seat to the desired position with slight body pressure and release the lever.

Do not place anything under the front seats.  
It might interfere with the seat-lock mechanism.

**CAUTION:**  
- This adjustment should not be made while the vehicle is moving, as the seat may unexpectedly move and cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.  
- After adjusting the seat, try sliding it forward and backward to make sure it is locked in position.

## — Adjusting seatback angle

- This adjustment should not be made while the vehicle is moving, as the seatback may unexpectedly move backward and cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

- After adjusting the seatback, exert body pressure to make sure it is locked in position.  
- To reduce the risk of sliding under the lap belt during a collision, avoid reclining the seatback any more than needed. The seat belts provide maximum protection when the driver and the passenger are sitting well back and straight up in the seats. If you are reclined, the lap belt may slide past your hips and apply restraint forces directly to the abdomen. Therefore, in the event of a frontal collision, the risk of personal injury may increase with increasing recline of the seatback.
