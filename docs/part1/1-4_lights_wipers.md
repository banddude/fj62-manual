# Headlight and turn signal switch

![10220-01]

To turn the lights on, twist the knob on the end of the lever.

FIRST CLICKSTOP: Only the parking, tail, license plate, side marker and instrument panel lights turn on.

SECOND CLICKSTOP: The headlights also turn on.

The key can be at any position.

NOTICE:  
To prevent the battery from being discharged, do not leave the lights on for a long period while the engine is not running.

**HIGH BEAM** →  
**HEADLIGHT FLASHER** →

For high beam, push the lever forward. Pull it back for low beam. For the headlight flasher, pull it further back.

A blue light on the dashboard indicates high beam.

The headlight flasher works even when the headlight switch is off.

![10220-03]  
**RIGHT TURN** ↑  
**LANE CHANGE** ↗  
**LEFT TURN** ↓

For signaling turns, move the lever up or down in the conventional manner.

The key must be in the "ON" position.

The turn signal is self-cancelling after a turn, but after a lane change, you may have to cancel it by hand. You can also signal a lane change by moving the turn signal lever part-way and holding it there. If the green dashboard light flashes faster than normal, it indicates that the front or rear turn signal bulb has burned out. If the dashboard light does not come on, the fuse or the indicator light itself has probably failed. You may change headlight beam even while the turn signal lights are flashing.

The turn signal light switch will not work when the emergency flashers are operating.
