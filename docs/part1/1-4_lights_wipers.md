# Headlight and turn signal switch

![10220-01]

To turn the lights on, twist the knob on the end of the lever.

FIRST CLICKSTOP: Only the parking, tail, license plate, side marker and instrument panel lights turn on.

SECOND CLICKSTOP: The headlights also turn on

The key can be at any position.

HIGH BEAM

RIGHT TURN  
LANE CHANGE  
LEFT TURN

For signaling turns, move the lever up or down in the conventional manner.

The key must be in the "ON" position.

The turn signal is self-cancelling after a turn, but after a lane change, you may have to cancel it by hand. You can also signal a lane change by moving the turn signal lever part-way and holding it there. If the green dashboard light flashes faster than normal, it indicates that the front or rear turn signal bulb has burned out. If the dashboard light does not come on, the fuse or the indicator light itself has probably failed. You may change headlight beam even while the turn signal lights are flashing.

(10260-02)

To turn the wipers on, move the lever. To make the washer squirt, push the button on the end of the lever.

Also, the wipers will automatically operate a couple of times after the washer squirts even with the lever in the "OFF" position.

Do not operate the wipers if the windshield is dry. It may scratch the glass.

If the washer does not work, check to see whether the washer tank is empty. For information on adding washer fluid, see "Adding washer fluid" in Chapter 7-3.

In cold weather, warm the windshield with the defroster before using the washer. This will help prevent icing, which could block your vision.
