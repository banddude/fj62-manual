# Ignition switch with steering lock

![10210101]

"START" - Starter motor on. The key will return to the "ON" position when released.

For starting tips, see Part 3.

"ON" - Engine on and all accessories on.

This is the normal driving position.

NOTICE:

Do not leave the key in the "ON" position if the engine is not running. The battery will discharge and the ignition could be damaged.

"ACC" - Accessories such as the radio operate, but the engine is off.

If you leave the key in the "ACC" or "LOCK" position and open the driver's door, a buzzer will remind you to remove the key.

38

![LOCK RELEASE BUTTON 10210102]

"LOCK" - Engine is off and the steering wheel is locked. The key can be removed only at this position.

You must press in the lock release button to turn the key from "ON" or "ACC" to the "LOCK" position. When starting the engine, the key may seem stuck at the "LOCK" position. To free it, first be sure the key is pushed all the way in, and then rock the steering wheel slightly while turning the key gently.

If, in an emergency, you must turn the engine off while the vehicle is in motion, turn the key only to "ACC".

CAUTION:........................................................

Never remove the key when the vehicle is moving, as this will lock the steering wheel and result in loss of steering control.

1. Start the engine as instructed in "How to start the engine" in Part 3.

The transmission must be in "P" or "N". The engine will not start in "R", "3", "2", "L" or "D" range even if the key is turned.

2. With your foot holding down the brake pedal, shift the selector lever to "D".

CAUTION::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Never put your foot on the accelerator pedal while shifting.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

3. Release the parking brake and brake pedal. Depress the accelerator pedal slowly for smooth starting.

The vehicle will start in the first gear and automatically shift to the second, third and overdrive gears according to the vehicle speed.

If you need to accelerate rapidly while driving, push the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor. The transmission will be automatically downshifted to the third, second or first gear, according to the vehicle speed.

If engine braking is needed, such as in descending a long hill, see "(b) Using engine braking."

To use the braking power of the engine, downshift the transmission in the way described below:

- Shift into the "3" range when the vehicle speed is lower than 81 mph (130 km/h). The transmission will downshift to the third gear.

- Shift into the "2" range when the vehicle speed is lower than 53 mph (85 km/h). The transmission will downshift to the second gear and more engine braking will be obtained.

- Shift into the "L" range when the vehicle speed is lower than 25 mph (40 km/h). The transmission will downshift to the first gear and maximum engine braking will be applied.

**CAUTION:**

Be careful when downshifting on a slippery surface. The abrupt change in engine speed could cause the vehicle to spin or skid.

**NOTICE:**

To prevent engine overrevving, do not downshift if you are going faster than the above speed in each range.

# (c) Using the "3", "2" and "L" ranges

The "3", "2" and "L" ranges are used for strong traction in addition to strong engine braking as described previously. The mechanism for this is that the transmission uses mainly lower gears.

With the selector lever in "3", "2" or "L", you can start the vehicle in motion as with the lever in "D".

With the selector lever in "3", the vehicle will start in the first gear and automatically shift to the second and third gears, but will not shift to the overdrive gear. This provides strong traction such as for climbing a gentle slope.

With the selector lever in "2", the transmission is engaged in the second gear and will not upshift or downshift at all. This provides strong traction such as for hill climbing.

With the selector lever in "L", the transmission is engaged in the first gear and will not upshift at all. This provides maximum traction such as for hard towing.

**NOTICE:**

Be careful not to overrev the engine. Watch the tachometer to keep engine rpm from going into the red zone. The maximum allowable speed (approximate) for each range is given below for your reference:

- "3" ........... 81 mph (130 km/h)  
- "2" ........... 53 mph (85 km/h)  
- "L" ........... 25 mph (40 km/h)

### (d) Backing up

- BRAKE PEDAL  
- SELECTOR LEVER  
- "R" (Reverse) range

1. Bring the vehicle to a complete stop.  
2. With the brake pedal held down with your foot, shift the selector lever to the "R" range.

**NOTICE:**  
Never shift into reverse while the vehicle is in motion.

### (e) Parking

- PARKING BRAKE LEVER  
- BRAKE PEDAL  
- SELECTOR LEVER  
- "P" (Park) range

1. Bring the vehicle to a complete stop.  
2. Pull the parking brake lever up fully to securely apply the parking brake.  
3. With the brake pedal held down with your foot, shift the selector lever to the "P" range.

**CAUTION:**  
While the vehicle is in motion, never attempt to move the selector lever into "P" under any circumstances. Serious mechanical damage and loss of vehicle control may result.

# (f) Good driving practice

- If the transmission is repeatedly upshifted and downshifted between the third and overdrive gears when climbing a gentle slope, it is suggested that the "3" range be used. Be sure to return to the "D" range immediately afterward.
- When towing a trailer, in order to maintain engine braking efficiency and electrical charging performance, do not use the "D" range.

CAUTION:
Always keep your foot on the brake pedal while stopped with the engine running. This prevents the vehicle from creeping.

NOTICE:
Do not hold the vehicle on an upgrade with the accelerator pedal. It can cause the transmission to overheat. Always use the brake pedal or parking brake.

# Four-wheel drive system — (a) Front drive control lever and "H4" button

(Image labels: H2 · N · L4 ; H4 ON OFF)

The function of each of the front drive control lever and "H4" button positions is described below.

The "4WD" indicator light shows when the front drive control lever is in the "L4" position or when the "H4" button is pushed in.

"H2": High range, two-wheel drive  
Use this for normal driving on dry hard-surfaced roads. This position gives greater economy, quietest ride and least wear. The "H4" button must be off.

"H4": High range, four-wheel drive  
Use this for normal driving on wet, icy or snow-covered roads. This position provides greater traction than two-wheel drive.

"N": Neutral  
No power is delivered to the wheels. Use this position only for operating a winch or other equipment. The vehicle must be stopped.

"L4": Low range, four-wheel drive  
Use this for maximum power and traction. Use "L4" for climbing or descending steep hills, off-road driving, and hard pulling in sand, mud or deep snow.

See "(c) Shifting procedure" for further instructions.

# (b) Free-wheeling hubs

![diagram]

To engage the free-wheeling hubs, turn the hubs to "LOCK". To disengage, turn the hubs to "FREE".

Make sure that the triangle mark on the hub aligns with the other one at the side you wish to set.

Setting the free-wheeling hubs in "FREE" allows you to disengage the front axle and driveshaft so that they are not revolving. This reduces noise and wear when the vehicle is in two-wheel drive.

You should drive with the hubs in "LOCK" for at least 10 miles (16 km) each month. This will assure that the front drive components are lubricated.

---

# (c) Shifting procedure

## SHIFTING BETWEEN "H2" AND "H4"

To shift from "H2" to "H4", push the "H4" button in to the ON position with the front drive control lever in the "H2" position and both the free-wheeling hubs engaged. Then release the accelerator pedal momentarily.

The vehicle may be moving at any speed.

CAUTION:
- Never move the front drive control lever if wheels are slipping. Stop the slipping or spinning before shifting.
- Never drive with only one hub engaged.

To shift from "H4" to "H2", push the "H4" button out to the OFF position. Disengage both the free-wheeling hubs for continued "H2" use.

The vehicle may be moving at any speed.

## SHIFTING BETWEEN "H2" AND "L4"

To shift from "H2" to "L4", stop the vehicle, shift the transmission into "P" or "N" and move the front drive control lever with both the free-wheeling hubs engaged. If you cannot shift, drive the vehicle slightly in either direction and try again.

To shift from "L4" to "H2", stop the vehicle, shift the transmission into "P" or "N" and move the front drive control lever. If you cannot shift, drive the vehicle slightly in either direction and try again.

Disengage both the free-wheeling hubs for continued "H2" use.

# Differential locks

![20150108]

The purpose of the differential locks is for use only when the vehicle has not enough traction to move itself.

The differential is designed to transmit power from the engine to the right and left wheels equally. If one wheel is off the ground or on a slippery surface, the power is used to spin the wheel, causing insufficient traction on the other wheel.

Locking the differential allows the right and left wheels to rotate as a unit, causing the vehicle to extract itself.

## Operating precautions

- If the vehicle does become stuck, first engage the four-wheel drive, low range (L4) to free it. If this has no effect, lock the rear, and if necessary, also the front differential.
- The order of operation is, rear-front lock and front-rear unlock.
- Be sure to unlock the differentials immediately after using the differential locks.
- Before normal driving, make sure that the differential control levers are pushed down and the indicator lights remain off.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Before locking the differentials, be sure that the wheels have stopped spinning. If not, the vehicle may move in an unexpected direction when the differential locks are engaged, resulting in an accident. This may also lead to possible damage to differential lock component parts.
- Do not use the differential locks on dry, hard roads. Large steering effort and careful cornering control will be required. Especially use of the front differential lock in addition to the rear will result in extremely difficult steering control.
- Do not drive on snow or ice with the differentials locked. Cornering may be difficult. If one wheel contacts a non-slippery surface during acceleration or engine braking, the vehicle may spin suddenly.

---

NOTICE:

Do not drive over 5 mph (8 km/h) when the differentials are locked.

# Cases in which the differential locks can be used effectively

These are some of the cases where the differential locks are effective. In every case, first apply the brakes to stop the wheel and engage the four-wheel drive, low range (L4). If this does not help, use the differential locks.

- Wheel off the road

  After pulling up on the control lever, depress the accelerator pedal gently. Shortly after the wheel has revolved, the differential will lock, causing both wheels to move as a unit to quickly get the wheel back on the road.

- Driving over rocky roads

  Keep both hands and especially your thumbs on the outside of the rim.

**CAUTION:** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do not grip the steering wheel spokes. The return motion can be so sudden and harsh that your hands may be injured.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

- Freeing from snow (wheels on one side on a slippery surface)

  After engaging the locks up, accelerate slowly out of the snow. Pressing down on the accelerator pedal too hard and too quickly can cause loss of vehicle control. When the entire vehicle is back on the road, do not forget to disengage the differential locks.

# Parking brake

(To set/release illustration)

To set: Pull up the lever.  
To release: Pull up slightly, press the thumb button, and lower.

Before leaving your vehicle, firmly apply the parking brake. For better holding power, first depress the brake pedal and hold it while setting the parking brake.

**CAUTION:** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Before driving, be sure that the parking brake is fully released and the parking brake reminder light is off.
