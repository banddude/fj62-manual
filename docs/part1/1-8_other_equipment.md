# Clock

![digital clock display](10410A01)

The multi-function clock indicates the time, operates the stop watch and sets off the alarm.

The display appears when the ignition switch is in the "ACC" or "ON" position. When the tail lights are turned on, the brightness of the display will be reduced.

## Clock

The time is displayed as power flows to the display.

To reset the hour, depress the "H" button.

The blinking "A" or "P" on the display means A.M. or P.M. respectively.

To reset the minute, depress the "M" button.

To adjust the clock to an even hour, depress the "SET" button. For example, if the button is depressed when the time is between 1:01–1:29, the time will change to 1:00. If the time is between 1:30–1:59, the time will change to 2:00.

## Stop watch

To switch to the stop watch mode, depress the "STOP.W" button.

To operate the stop watch, depress the "STOP.W" button repeatedly according to the instructions below:

1. 1st — starts timing  
2. 2nd — stops  
3. 3rd — resets to zero  
4. 4th — returns to clock

After the display reaches "19:59.9", it will begin from zero.

## Alarm

To switch to the alarm mode, depress the "ALM" button.

To set the alarm, adjust the display to the desired time by the same procedure as described in the clock mode. Then depress the "SET" button. The point next to the minute display tells that the alarm is set. After 6 seconds, the display will automatically return to the clock mode.

The alarm will sound for 1 minute even when the ignition is turned off. To stop the alarm, depress any button.

If the alarm setting is not started within 6 seconds after switching to the alarm mode, the display automatically returns to the clock mode.

To change the alarm setting, readjust the display. Depressing the "SET" button is not necessary.

To cancel the alarm setting, depress the "SET" button. Make sure that the point next to the minute display has disappeared.

Once the electrical power source has been disconnected, the clock memory is cancelled. When electrical power is restarted, the time is automatically set to one o'clock A.M.
