# Car audio operating tips

![SERVICE AREA diagram]

SERVICE AREA
- FM (stereo)
- FM (monaural)
- AM
- MULTIPATH
- STATIC  
(10563-01)

You can listen to the car audio when the ignition key is at "ON" or "ACC". However, if the engine is not running, the key must be in the "ACC" position.

NOTICE:  
To prevent the battery from being discharged, do not leave the car audio on for a long period while the engine is not running.

RADIO  
Adjust the length of your antenna for best reception. Usually a short length is best in large cities and a fully extended antenna is best for distant reception.

Before extending the antenna, confirm that there is no one close enough to get poked.

---

NOTICE:  
To prevent damage to the antenna, make sure it is retracted before running your vehicle through an automatic car wash.

FM reception tips  
A vehicle is not an ideal place to listen to a radio. Because it moves, reception conditions are constantly changing. Buildings, terrain, signal distance and noise from other vehicles are all working against good reception. Some conditions of FM may appear to be problems when they are not. The following characteristics are completely normal for a given reception area, and they do not indicate any problem with the radio itself.

- Fading and Drifting: FM range is limited to about 25 miles (40 km), except for some high power stations.

  If a vehicle is moving away from the desired station's transmitter, the signal will tend to fade and/or drift. This is a more remarkable phenomenon than with AM, and is accompanied by distortion.

  Fading and drifting can be minimized to a certain degree by careful attention to fine tuning, or you should retune the radio to a stronger signal.

- Static and Fluttering: When the line-of-sight link between a transmitter and vehicle is blocked by large buildings or the like, the radio sound may be accompanied with static or fluttering because of the characteristic of FM. In a similar effect, a fluttering noise is sometimes heard when driving along a tree-lined road.

  This static and fluttering can be reduced by adjusting the tone control for greater bass response until the disturbance has passed.

- Multipath: Because of the reflecting characteristics of FM, direct and reflected signals may reach the antenna at the same time (multipath) and cancel each other out. As a vehicle moves through these electronic dead spots, the listener may hear a momentary flutter or loss of reception.

- Station swapping: When two FM stations are close to each other, and an electronic dead spot, such as static or multipath area, interrupts the original signal, sometimes the stronger second signal will be selected automatically until the original one returns. This swapping can also occur as you drive away from the selected station and approach another station of a stronger signal.

CASSETTE TAPE PLAYER

- Use only cassette tapes of good quality, having no damage. Avoid using tapes with a total playing time longer than 90 minutes.

  Using damaged tapes would put the tape player into trouble. Longer tapes are not recommended because of their thinness.

- Be sure that the tape is not slack and that the label is firmly stuck on the shell before insertion.

  Have the tape firmly wound around the tape by turning the hub with a pencil or the like.

  Be careful not to touch the disclosed tape surface.

When not in use, take the cassette out of the player, put it back into its case and store it away from dust, magnets and direct sunlight.

Leaving the cassettes on the dashboard in the sun could result in damaged tapes.

Keep the playback head, capstan and pinch roller clean.

Remove tape coating residue accumulated on the head, capstan and pinch roller once or twice a month. A cleaning tape is available on the market.

NOTICE:

Do not oil any part of the player and do not insert metal goods or a magnet into the slot, or the tape player may be damaged.
