# Front seats —
## Adjusting seat position

Pull the lock release lever sideways. Then slide the seat to the desired position with slight body pressure and release the lever.

Do not place anything under the front seats. It might interfere with the seat-lock mechanism.

CAUTION:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- This adjustment should not be made while the vehicle is moving, as the seat may unexpectedly move and cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.
- After adjusting the seat, try sliding it forward and backward to make sure it is locked in position.

---

## Adjusting seatback angle

Lean forward and pull the lock release lever. Then lean back to the desired angle and release the lever.

If desired, the seatbacks may be fully reclined. They return to the upright position when the lever is pulled and no weight is on them.

CAUTION:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- This adjustment should not be made while the vehicle is moving, as the seatback may unexpectedly move backward and cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

- After adjusting the seatback, exert body pressure to make sure it is locked in position.
- To reduce the risk of sliding under the lap belt during a collision, avoid reclining the seatback any more than needed. The seat belts provide maximum protection when the driver and the passenger are sitting well back and straight up in the seats. If you are reclined, the lap belt may slide past your hips and apply restraint forces directly to the abdomen. Therefore, in the event of a frontal collision, the risk of personal injury may increase with increasing recline of the seatback.

# Seat belts —
## — Seat belt precautions

Toyota recommends that the driver and passengers in the vehicle be properly restrained at all times with the seat belts provided. Failure to do so could increase the chance of injury and/or the severity of injury in accidents.

Baby or small child. Use a child restraint system which fits your vehicle. See "Child restraint" for details.

Children. If they are too big for child restraint systems, they should sit in the rear seat and be restrained with the seat belts. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat. Do not allow the child to stand up or kneel on the seat. If the shoulder belt falls across the child's neck or face, move the child to the center position and use the center lap belt.

Pregnant woman. Toyota recommends the use of a seat belt. Ask your doctor for specific recommendations. The lap belt should be worn securely and as low as possible over the hips and not on the waist.

Injured person. Toyota recommends the use of a seat belt. Depending on the injury, however, first check with your doctor.

---

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Persons should ride in their seats properly wearing their seat belts whenever the vehicle is moving. Otherwise, they are much more likely to suffer serious bodily injury, in the event of sudden braking or a collision.

When using the seat belts, observe the following:

- Use the belt for only one person at a time. Do not use a single belt for two or more people—even children.
- Avoid reclining the seatbacks too much. The seat belts provide maximum protection when the seatbacks are in the upright position. (See "Adjusting seatback angle".)
- Be careful not to damage the belt webbing or hardware, and take care that they do not get caught or pinched in the seat or doors.
- Inspect the belt system periodically. Check for cuts, frays, and loose parts. Damaged parts should be replaced. Do not disassemble or modify the system.

- Keep the belts clean and dry. If they need cleaning, use a mild soap solution or lukewarm water. Never use bleach, dye, or abrasive cleaners—they may severely weaken the belts.

- Replace the belt assembly if it has been used in a severe impact. The entire assembly should be replaced even if damage is not obvious.

- 3-point type seat belts

Adjust the seat as needed and sit well back in the seat and straight up. To fasten your belt, pull it out of the retractor and insert the tab into the buckle.

You will hear a click when the tab locks into the buckle.

The seat belt length automatically adjusts to your size and the seat position.

The retractor will lock the belt during a sudden stop or on impact. At other times you can move around freely.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After inserting the tab, make sure that the connection is secure and the belt is not twisted.

Adjust the position of the lap and shoulder belts.

Position the lap belt as low as possible on your hips — not on your waist, then adjust it to a snug fit by pulling the shoulder portion upward through the latch plate.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- High-positioned lap belts and loose-fitting shoulder belts both could increase the chance of injury due to sliding under the lap belt during an accident.

- For your safety, do not place the shoulder belt under your arm.

## — Seat belt extender

If your seat belt cannot be fastened securely because it is not long enough, a personalized seat belt extender is available from your Toyota dealer free of charge.

Please contact your local Toyota dealer so that the dealer can order the proper required length for the extender. Bring the heaviest coat you expect to wear for proper measurement and selection of length. Additional ordering information is available at your Toyota dealer.

**CAUTION::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::**

When using the seat belt extender, observe the following. Failure to follow these instructions could result in less effectiveness of the seat belt restraint system in case of vehicle accident, causing personal injury.

- Never use the seat belt extender if you can fasten the seat belt without it.
- Remember that the extender provided for you may not be safe when used on a different vehicle, or for another person and at different seating position than specified.

---

To connect the extender to the seat belt, insert the tab into the seat belt buckle so that the buckle-release buttons of the extender and the seat belt are located on the same side as shown.

You will hear a click when the tab locks into the buckle.

When releasing the seat belt, press on the buckle-release button on the extender, not on the seat belt. This helps prevent damage to the vehicle interior and extender itself.

When not in use, remove the extender and store in the vehicle for future use.

*To release the belt, press the buckle-release button.*

# Child restraint—
## —Child restraint precautions

Toyota strongly urges the use of child restraint systems for children small enough for the child restraint system.

The laws of all fifty states in the U.S.A. and most provinces in Canada now require the use of child restraint system.

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For effective protection in automobile accidents and sudden stops, children must not be transported unrestrained. Holding a child in your arms is not a substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, a child held in a person's arms can be crushed between the vehicle's interior and an unrestrained person.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CAUTION:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After inserting the tab, make sure that the connection is secure and the seat belt extender is not twisted.

## —Child restraint system

A child restraint system for a small child or baby must be restrained on the seat with either the lap belt or the lap portion of the lap/shoulder belt.

The child restraint system should conform to the size of the child and properly fit the vehicle seat. For a higher degree of safety, the child restraint system should be installed in the rear seat. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.

When installing a child restraint system, you must use a locking clip for the following seat belts.

* Front seat belt
* Rear outside seat belt

When installing a child restraint system, refer to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the system and follow the directions listed under the following illustrations.

If the locking clip does not come with your child restraint system, you can purchase it from your Toyota dealer.

* Locking clip (Part No. 73119-22010)

## Outside rear view mirrors—

Adjust the mirror so you can just see the side of your vehicle in the portion of the mirror closest to the vehicle.

Be careful when judging the size or distance of any object seen in the outside rear view mirror on the passenger's side. It is a convex mirror with a curved surface. Any object seen in a convex mirror will look smaller and farther away than when seen in a flat mirror.
