# Protecting your Toyota from corrosion

Toyota, through its diligent research, design and utilizing the most advanced technology available, has done its part to help prevent corrosion and has provided you with the finest quality vehicle construction. Now, it is up to you. Proper care of your Toyota can help ensure long-term corrosion prevention.

## The most common causes of corrosion to your vehicle are:
- The accumulation of road salt, dirt and moisture in hard-to-reach areas under the vehicle.
- Chipping of paint, or undercoating caused by minor accidents or by stones and gravel.

## Care is especially important if you live in a particular area or operate your vehicle under certain environmental conditions:
- Road salt or dust control chemicals will accelerate corrosion, as will the presence of salt in the air near the sea-coast or in areas of industrial pollution.
- High humidity accelerates corrosion especially when temperatures range just above the freezing point.
- Wetness or dampness to certain parts of your vehicle for an extended period of time, may cause corrosion even though other parts of the vehicle may be dry.
- High temperatures will cause corrosion to those components of the vehicle which are prevented from quick-drying due to lack of proper ventilation.

The above signifies the necessity to keep your vehicle, particularly the underside, as clean as possible and to repair any damage to paint or protective coatings as soon as possible.

To help prevent corrosion on your Toyota, follow these guidelines:

### Wash your vehicle frequently.
It is, of course, necessary to keep your vehicle clean by regular washing, but to prevent corrosion, the following points should be observed:
- If you drive on salted roads in the winter or if you live near the ocean, you should hose off the undercarriage at least once a month to minimize corrosion.
- High pressure water or steam is effective for cleaning the vehicle's underside and wheel housings. Pay particular attention to these areas as it is difficult to see all the mud and dirt. It will do more harm than good to simply wet the mud and debris without removing them. The lower edge of doors, rocker panels and frame members have drain holes which should not be allowed to clog with dirt as trapped water in these areas can cause corrosion.
- Wash the underside of the vehicle thoroughly when winter is over.

See "Washing and waxing your Toyota" for more tips.

### Check the condition of your vehicle's paint and trim.
If you find any chips or scratches in the paint, touch them up immediately to prevent corrosion from starting. If the chips or scratches have gone through the bare metal, have a qualified body shop make the repair.

### Check the interior of your vehicle.
Water and dirt can accumulate under the floor mats and could cause corrosion. Occasionally check under the mats to make sure the area is dry. Be particularly careful when transporting chemicals, cleansers, fertilizers, salt, etc., and these should be transported in proper containers. If a spill or leak should occur, immediately clean and dry the area.

### Use mud shields on your wheels.
If you drive on salted or gravel roads, mud shields help protect your vehicle. Full-size shields, which come as near to the ground as possible, are the best. We recommend that the fittings and the area where the shields are installed be treated to resist corrosion. Your Toyota dealer will be happy to assist in supplying and installing the shields if they are recommended for your area.

# Washing and waxing your Toyota

**Do not park your vehicle in a damp, poorly ventilated garage.**  
If you wash your vehicle in the garage, or if you drive it in covered with water or snow, your garage may be so damp it will cause corrosion. Even if your garage is heated, a wet vehicle can corrode in it if the ventilation is poor.

Wash your vehicle in the shade when the body is not hot to the touch. Use a mild car-wash soap and rinse it well.

Dirt can cause small scratches in the paint and the chemicals in some dirt and air pollutants can cause deterioration of the paint and trim. Therefore, frequent washing is recommended. If you park or drive your Toyota near the ocean or on salted roads, it is especially important to prevent corrosion.

Your vehicle can be washed in an automatic car wash. Remember, however, that the paint surface could then be scratched with the brushes. Scratches reduce the paint's gloss retention and durability. They can become apparent easily, especially on the darker paints.

The following is the adequate procedure of car washing by hand.

1. Begin by rinsing all loose dirt off the vehicle with a hose. If the underside has picked up mud or road salt, use a hard, direct stream from a hose to remove it.  
2. Wash with a commercial car-wash product available at your Toyota dealer or auto parts store. Follow the manufacturer's mixing instructions carefully. Dip your sponge or cloth into the wash bucket frequently and do not rub too hard—let the soap and water remove the dirt.

Road tar may be removed with turpentine. Use warm water and car-wash soap for insects and tree sap. Commercial products are also available.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not use gasoline or strong solvents, which may be toxic or cause damage.

3. Rinse the vehicle thoroughly. If any soap dries on the vehicle, it may cause streaking. In hot weather, you may have to rinse each section of the vehicle right after you wash it.  
4. Dry the vehicle with a moist chamois or soft towel. The main purpose of drying is to remove excess water so that the vehicle will air dry without water spots. So do not rub or press hard, which might scratch the paint.

If you detect any stone chips or scratches in the paint, touch them up immediately to protect the bare metal from corrosion.

After washing your vehicle, make sure the brakes are fully dry before driving.

Polishing and waxing is recommended to maintain the original beauty of your Toyota's finish.

1. Always wash and dry the vehicle before you begin waxing, even if you are using a combined cleaner and wax.

2. Use a good quality polish and wax. If the finish has become extremely weathered, use a car-cleaning polish, followed by a separate wax. Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions and precautions. Be sure to polish and wax the chrome trim as well as the paint.

3. Wax the vehicle again when water does not bead but remains on the surface in large patches.

# Cleaning the interior

The vinyl upholstery may be easily cleaned with a mild soap or detergent and water.

First vacuum over the upholstery to remove loose dirt. Then, using a sponge or soft cloth, apply the soap solution to the vinyl. After allowing it to soak in for a few minutes to loosen the dirt, remove the dirt and wipe off the soap with a clean damp cloth. If all the dirt does not come off, repeat the procedure. Commercial foaming-type vinyl cleaners are also available which work well. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.

**NOTICE:**

Do not use solvent, thinner, gasoline or window cleaner on the interior

Use a good foam-type shampoo to clean the carpets.

Begin by vacuuming thoroughly to remove as much dirt as possible. Several types of foam cleaners are available; some are in aerosol cans and others are powders or liquids which you mix with water to produce a foam. To shampoo the carpets, use a sponge or brush to apply the foam. Rub in overlapping circles. Do not apply water — the best results are obtained by keeping the carpet as dry as possible. Read the shampoo instructions and follow them closely.

The seat belts may be cleaned with mild soap and water or with lukewarm water.

Use a cloth or sponge. As you are cleaning, check the belts for excessive wear, fraying, or cuts.

**NOTICE:**

Do not use dye or bleach on the belts — it may weaken them.

The windows may be cleaned with any household window cleaner.

**NOTICE:**

When cleaning the inside of the windows, be careful not to scratch or damage the heater wires on the rear window.

If you have any questions about the cleaning of your Toyota, your local Toyota dealer will be pleased to answer them.
