With the "WINDOW LOCK" switch pressed in, the windows cannot be raised or lowered.

- When small children are in the vehicle, take care not to allow them unexpected use of the switches. Use the window locking feature described above or, if you must leave them unattended, remove the key from the ignition switch.
- When closing the windows, be sure that no one has his/her head, hands or arms sticking out the window.
