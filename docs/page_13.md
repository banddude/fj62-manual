## CAUTION:
Before driving, be sure that the doors are closed and locked, especially when small children are in the vehicle. Along with the proper use of seat belts, locking the doors helps prevent the driver and passengers from being thrown out from the vehicle during an accident. It also helps prevent the doors from being opened unintentionally.
