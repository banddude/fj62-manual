The key works in every lock.  
Since the doors can be locked without a key, you should always carry a spare key in case you accidentally lock your key inside the vehicle.

KEY NUMBER PLATE

10050F02

Keep the key number plate in a safe place such as your wallet, not in the vehicle.  
If you should lose your key or if you need additional keys, duplicates should be made by a Toyota dealer using the key number.  

You should also put a copy of the key number with your important papers.
