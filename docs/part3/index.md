# Before starting the engine

1. Check the area around the vehicle before entering it.  
2. Adjust seat position, seatback angle, headrest height and steering wheel angle.  
3. Adjust inside and outside rear view mirrors.  
4. Lock all doors.  
5. Fasten seat belts.

Remember to check that the warning lights function when turning the key to "ON", and check the fuel gauge to see that you have sufficient fuel.

# How to start the engine

## (a) Before cranking

1. Apply the parking brake firmly.  
2. Turn off unnecessary lights and accessories.  
3. Put the selector lever in "P". If you need to restart the engine while the vehicle is moving, put the selector lever in "N". A starter safety device will prevent the starter from operating if the selector lever is in any drive position.  
4. Depress the brake pedal and hold it to the floor until driving off.

## (b) Starting the engine

Before starting the engine, be sure to follow the instructions in "(a) Before cranking".

### Normal starting procedure

The electronic fuel injection system in your engine automatically controls the proper air-fuel mixture for starting. So you can start the cold or hot engine as follows:

1. With your foot off the accelerator pedal, crank the engine by turning the key to "START". Release it when the engine starts.  
2. After the engine warms up for about 10 seconds, you are ready to drive.

If the weather is below freezing, let it warm up for a few minutes before driving. Do not leave the vehicle while the engine is warming up.

If the engine stalls...  
Simply restart it, using the correct procedure given in normal starting.

If the engine will not start—  
See "If your vehicle will not start" in Part 4.

**NOTICE:**  
Do not crank for more than 15 seconds at a time.  
Do not race a cold engine.  
If the engine becomes difficult to start or stalls frequently, have the engine checked immediately.

# Tips for driving in various conditions

- Always slow down in gusty crosswinds. This will allow you much better control.  
- If you have a flat tire while driving, do not brake suddenly. Keep a straight line while reducing speed. Then slowly move completely off the road to a safe place.  
- When parking on a hill, turn the front wheels until they touch the curb so that the vehicle will not roll. Apply the parking brake, and place the transmission in "P". If necessary, block the wheels.  
- Washing your vehicle or driving through deep water may get the brakes wet. To see whether they are wet, check for no traffic near you, and then press the pedal lightly. If you do not feel a normal braking force, the brakes are probably wet. To dry them, drive the vehicle cautiously while lightly pressing the brake pedal. If they still do not work safely, pull to the side of the road and call a Toyota dealer for assistance.  
- Toyota recommends not using four-wheel drive on dry hard-surfaced roads, because four-wheel driving will cause unnecessary noise and wear, and poor fuel economy.

# CAUTION:

- Before driving off, make sure that the parking brake is fully released and the parking brake reminder light is off.

- Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal while driving. It can cause dangerous overheating, needless wear, and poor fuel economy.

- To drive down a long or steep hill, reduce your speed and downshift. Remember, if you ride the brakes excessively, they may overheat and not work properly.

- Be careful when accelerating, upshifting, downshifting or braking on a slippery surface. The abrupt change in engine speed, such as sudden acceleration or engine braking, could cause the vehicle to spin or skid.

- Do not drive over 85 mph (140 km/h) unless your vehicle has high-speed capability tires, regardless of the legal speed limit. Driving over 85 mph (140 km/h) may result in tire failure, loss of control and possible injury. Be sure to consult a tire dealer to determine whether the tires on your vehicle are high-speed capability tires or not before driving at such speeds.

- Do not continue normal driving when the brakes are wet. If they are wet, your vehicle will require a longer stopping distance, and it may pull to one side when the brakes are applied.
