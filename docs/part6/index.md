# Part 6  VEHICLE MAINTENANCE AND CARE

- Maintenance requirements
- General maintenance
- Does your vehicle need repairing?
- Scheduled maintenance

The seat belts may be cleaned with mild soap and water or with lukewarm water.

Use a cloth or sponge. As you are cleaning, check the belts for excessive wear, fraying, or cuts.

**NOTICE:**

Do not use dye or bleach on the belts — it may weaken them.

The windows may be cleaned with any household window cleaner.

**NOTICE:**

When cleaning the inside of the windows, be careful not to scratch or damage the heater wires on the rear window.

If you have any questions about the cleaning of your Toyota, your local Toyota dealer will be pleased to answer them.

# Maintenance requirements

Your Toyota vehicle has been designed to give less maintenance requirements with long service interval to save both your time and money. However, each regular maintenance as well as day-to-day care is more important than ever before to ensure smooth and trouble-free, safe, and economical drivings.

It is owner's responsibility to make sure that the specified maintenance including general maintenance services is performed. Note that both the new vehicle and emission control system warranties specify that proper maintenance and care must be performed. See Owner's Guide or Warranty Booklet for complete warranty information.

## General maintenance

General maintenance items are those day-to-day care practices that are important to your vehicle for proper operation. It is the owner's responsibility to insure that the general maintenance items are performed regularly.

These checks or inspections can be done either by yourself or a qualified technician, or if you prefer, your Toyota dealer will be pleased to do them at a nominal cost.

## Scheduled maintenance

The scheduled maintenance items listed in this part are those required to be serviced at regular intervals.

---

However, under severe driving conditions, a separate maintenance schedule that requires more frequent maintenance service should be practiced.

It is recommended that any replacement parts used for maintenance or for the repair of the emission control system be Toyota supplied.

The owner may elect to use non-Toyota supplied parts for replacement purposes without invalidating the emission control system warranty. However, use of replacement parts which are not of equivalent quality may impair the effectiveness of the emission control systems.

You may also elect to have maintenance, replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and system performed by any automotive repair establishment or individual without invalidating this warranty. See Owner's Guide or Warranty Booklet for complete warranty information.

### Where to go for service?

Toyota technicians are well-trained specialists and are kept up to date with the latest service information through technical bulletins, service tips, and in-dealership training programs. They learn to work on Toyotas before they work on your vehicle, rather than while they are working on it.

You can be confident that your Toyota dealer's service department performs the best job to meet the maintenance requirements on your vehicle — reliably and economically.

Your copy of the repair order is proof that all required maintenance has been performed for warranty coverage. And if any problems should arise with your vehicle while under warranty, your Toyota dealer will promptly take care of it. Again, be sure to keep a copy of the repair order for any service performed on your Toyota.

### What about do-it-yourself maintenance?

Many of the maintenance items are easy to do yourself if you have a little mechanical ability and a few basic automotive tools. Simple instructions for how to perform them are presented in Part 7.

If you are a skilled do-it-yourself mechanic, the Toyota service manuals are recommended. Please be aware that do-it-yourself maintenance can affect your warranty coverage. See your separate warranty statement for the details.

# Does your vehicle need repairing?

Be on the alert for changes in performance, sounds, and visual tip-offs that indicate service is needed. Some important clues are as follows:

- Engine missing, stumbling, or pinging
- Appreciable loss of power
- Strange engine noises
- A leak under the vehicle (however, water dripping from the air conditioner after use is normal.)
- Change in exhaust sound (This may indicate a dangerous carbon monoxide leak. Drive with the windows open and have the exhaust system checked immediately.)
- Flat-looking tire; excessive tire squeal when cornering; uneven tire wear
- Vehicle pulls to one side when driving straight on a level road
- Strange noises related to suspension movement
- Loss of brake effectiveness; spongy feeling brake pedal; pedal almost touches floor; vehicles pull to one side when braking
- Engine temperature continually higher than normal

- Loss of brake effectiveness; spongy feeling brake pedal; pedal almost touches floor; vehicles pull to one side when braking
- Engine temperature continually higher than normal
- Engine continually runs hot; oil pressure gauge stays low

If you notice any of these clues, take your vehicle to your Toyota dealer as soon as possible. It probably needs adjustment or repair.

**CAUTION:**  
Do not continue driving with the vehicle unchecked. It could result in serious vehicle damage and possibly personal injury.

## Scheduled maintenance —

Driving conditions under which you mainly operate your vehicle determine which maintenance schedule you follow.

In order to ensure smooth, trouble-free, safe and economical driving, Toyota provides two kinds of maintenance schedules to be selected according to your driving conditions: schedules A and B. The instructions on which schedule to follow are given on the next page.

An odometer reading or time interval determines when service is necessary.

For most people, the odometer reading will indicate when service is needed. If, however, you drive very little, your vehicle should be serviced at regular time intervals as shown in the schedule.

The maintenance services beyond the last period should be performed at the same intervals.

The service interval of each item can be obtained from the maintenance schedule.
