After lifting the hood up, hold it open by inserting the support rod into the slot.

The end of the rod should be inserted into the slot in the front edge of the hood.

Before closing the hood, check to see that you have not forgotten any tools, rags, etc. and return the support rod to its clip—this prevents rattles. Then lower the hood and make sure it locks into place. If necessary, press down gently on the front edge to lock it.

CAUTION:
After inserting the rod, make sure it supports the hood securely.
